In the context of procurement reform, the Secretary-General introduced a \nnumber of measures to strengthen internal control and promote ethics, integrity, \nfairness and transparency in the procurement process, including the establishment of \nan independent mechanism to review challenges to procurement awards. Together \nwith the current policies on financial disclosure, conflict of interest prevention, \nwhistle-blower protection and an enterprise risk management framework, these \nmeasures would prevent, or mitigate, the recurrence of such a situation. \n \n \n \nExternal audit \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n31. Resources committed to audit the programme were inadequate in relation \nto its size. \n32. The scope of the audit by the Board of Auditors was narrowly defined, \nfocusing particularly on the accuracy of financial statements, while the internal \ncontrol environment of programme activity received little attention. \n33. External audits failed to audit and test some of the programme\xe2\x80\x99s most \ncritical areas \xe2\x80\x94 including pricing of oil and humanitarian goods \xe2\x80\x94 and to \nassess their impact on the programme\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements. \n \n \n \nAssessment \n \n34. The envisaged enterprise risk management approach would help to identify \nand mitigate risks. The Board of Auditors is an independent body and is solely \nresponsible for the conduct of its audits. However, Regulation 7.4 of the Financial \nRegulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) provides that the \naudits are to be conducted in conformity with generally accepted common auditing \nstandards and subject to any special directions of the General Assembly. Regulation \n7.7 further provides that the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \nQuestions may request the Board of Auditors to perform certain specific \nexaminations. With a robust enterprise risk management framework, the General \nAssembly would benefit from the identification of high-risk areas, which could \nprovide additional guidance in identifying areas for possible special audits. \n \n'"

The Advisory Committee trusts that environmental sustainability will \nextend to the entire United Nations Secretariat. The Committee recommends that \nthe General Assembly request the Secretary-General to include in future \nprogress reports specific information on outcomes, results and financial \nimplications, including costs and benefits for the United Nations Secretariat and \nfor peacekeeping operations.

As described in the report of the Secretary-General, the onset of the COVID-19 \npandemic in 2020 has impacted the progress in some accountability-related measures, \nsuch as the implementation of the second phase of the agile performance management \npilot, which was temporarily delayed but has now proceeded (A/75/686, para. 32). \nThe Secretary-General also indicates that the Secretariat plans to engage with the \nmain groups of Member States on the format of the proposed programme budget for \n2022 and that the respective budget proposals and performance reports will \nincorporate information on the impact of the liquidity crisis and the impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic during 2020, as per General Assembly resolutions 75/243 and \n75/252. The Committee was furthermore informed that the COVID-19-related impact \non the accountability efforts and their progress was a result of the change of working \nmethods, with mandatory telecommuting, as well as the need to redirect internal \nhuman resources capacity to address a number of urgent administrative needs \nregarding COVID-19, such as the preparation of new COVID-19-related \nadministrative guidelines and policy guidance. \n25. The Advisory Committee recalls its comments and recommendations on the \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its first report on the proposed programme \nbudget for 2021, including its request that the Secretary-General provide more \ninformation on the impact of the pandemic in the next proposed programme budget, \ninter alia, on lessons learned, best practices, efficiency measures, harmonization and \ncooperation across the United Nations system (A/75/7, chap. I, paras. 12\xe2\x80\x9315). \n \n \n \nIII. Recommendations \n \n \n26.

With \nrespect to the evaluation of the United Nations accountability system, currently \nconducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and to be concluded in \nJune 2021, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly \nrequest the Secretary-General to present the findings, including any financial \nimplications, in the eleventh progress report on the accountability system. \nSubject to its observations and recommendations in the paragraphs above, the \nCommittee recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to \npresent in future progress reports, the specific outcomes (including specific \ninstances when staff and senior managers were held accountable and the \nresulting actions), quantitative and qualitative results, and associated costs, as \nthey pertain to the various components of the accountability system. \n \n'"

In 2017, I have introduced a series of reform \ninitiatives designed to enable the Secretariat to deliver on the promises of the \nCharter.

The attainment of the standards of conduct for the international civil service \nrequires the highest commitment of all parties. International civil servants must be \ncommitted to the values, principles and standards set forth herein. They are \nexpected to uphold them in a positive and active manner. They should feel \nresponsible for contributing to the broad ideals to which they dedicated themselves \nin joining the United Nations system. Organizations have the obligation to \nimplement these standards through their policy framework, including rules, \nregulations and other administrative instruments. For their part, member States are \nexpected, through their allegiance to the Charter and other constituent instruments, \nto preserve the independence and impartiality of the international civil service. \n53. For these standards to be effectively applied, it is essential that they be widely \ndisseminated and that measures be taken and mechanisms put in place to ensure that \ntheir scope and importance are understood throughout the international civil service, \nthe member States and the organizations of the United Nations system. \n54. Respect for these standards assures that the international civil service will \ncontinue to be an effective instrument in fulfilling its responsibilities and in meeting \nthe aspirations of the peoples of the world. \n \n16-12690 (E)    290716 \n*1612690* \n \n'"

Specifically, a large number of users have \nconfigured their United Nations e-mail accounts to forward all messages to external \ne-mail accounts, resulting in the repeated rejection of legitimate e-mail by external \nservice providers because of the large volume of messages received.  \n4. \nIn order to restore the technical integrity and performance of the e-mail \nsystem, the limitation of automated e-mail forwarding is being implemented in \naccordance with paragraph 6.1 (b) of Secretary-General\xe2\x80\x99s bulletin ST/SGB/2004/15. \n5. \nIn addition, the automatic and indiscriminate forwarding of e-mail messages to \nexternal recipients, including to the personal e-mail accounts of staff members, is \ninconsistent with the Organization\xe2\x80\x99s objective to retain all rights with regard to \ninformation and communications technology resources and data. All authorized \nusers are provided with alternative mechanisms (e.g. webmail, IBM Notes Traveler, \nUnite Connections) to access the Organization\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail system at any time and from \nany location, without the need for automatic forwarding.

Fines\nshould be paid or contested within the time period mentioned in the citation.\nMembers of the diplomatic community who enjoy immunity will not be\nrequired to appear in judicial proceedings or otherwise to submit personally to the\ncivil or administrative jurisdiction of the United States. Non-diplomatic personnel\nmay, as in the past, be obliged to appear in judicial or administrative hearings to\nestablish the facts in order to invoke an official acts immunity defence.

The United Nations Secretariat will note that, for all hours \nworked, such domestic workers must be paid the greater of the minimum wage under \nUnited States federal or state law or the prevailing wage in the specific location (city \nand state) of the residence where the domestic worker is employed.  \n \nThe United States Mission wishes to inform the United Nations Secretariat that, \naccording to article 19 of the New York State Labor Law, all employees in New York \nState, including domestic workers, must be paid at least the applicable hourly wage \nrate. The City of New York has updated its minimum wage requirement to $13.50 per \nhour for the period beginning 31 December 2018 and ending 30 December 2019. The \ncurrent minimum wage rate for employers with less than 10 employees in the \nNew York City area may be found online at the New York State Department of Labor \nwebsite (www.labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/workprot/minwage.shtm).  \n \nTherefore, domestic workers employed in residences in the New York City \nmetropolitan area must be paid in accordance with the local minimum wage rate noted \nabove. In addition, all new contracts between domestic workers and their employers \nmust reflect the updated wage amounts and all existing contracts already in effect \nmust be amended to reflect the updated wage amounts, with the changes initialled by \nboth the domestic worker and the employer. \n \n'"

This circular \nnote replaces the United States Mission\xe2\x80\x99s note of March 16, 1987 on the same subject. \n \nFor the purposes of the application in the United States of paragraph 37 of the \nVienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, operative for Permanent Missions to the \nUnited Nations through Section 15 of the Headquarters Agreement between the \nUnited States and the United Nations, \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\xa6forming part of\xe2\x80\xa6household\xe2\x80\x9d means \nthe spouse of the member of the Mission and his or her unmarried children under 21 \nyears of age, who are not members of some other household, and who reside \nexclusively in the Mission member\xe2\x80\x99s household. Additionally, the term \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d \nincludes the Mission member\xe2\x80\x99s children under 23 years of age, provided that such \nchildren are attending an institution of higher learning on a full-time basis. \n \nOther persons who are not members of some other household, who reside \nexclusively in the Mission member\xe2\x80\x99s household, and who are recognized by the \nsending state as members of the family forming part of that household, may be \nconsidered \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of the Vienna Convention under very \nexceptional circumstances and with the expressed approval of the United States \nGovernment. In such cases, a formal request for consideration by the United States \nDepartment of State must be submitted to the United States Mission. The request must \ninclude full justification for the requested exception. \n \nThe attention of the Permanent Missions is also drawn to the applicable \nprovisions of international law in respect of termination status of family members. \nWhenever any person who has been accorded \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d status for the purposes of \ndiplomatic privileges and immunities in the United States ceases to reside with the \nprincipal Mission member, marries, or otherwise ceases to be part of the Mission \nmember\xe2\x80\x99s household, such person immediately ceases to be a member of the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d \nwithin the meaning of international law and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \nRelations. Accordingly, all privileges and immunities to which such person had been \nentitled in the United States would terminate. \n \nIt is emphasized that the standard set forth in this note is solely to define \nmembers of the family pursuant to the terms of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \nRelations with regard to the extension of diplomatic privileges and immunities. It is \nwithout prejudice to other definitions of family for other purposes such as the \ncontinued eligibility for \xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x9d visa status, which have an independent basis in \ninternational agreements or United States domestic law. \n \nThe United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this opportunity \nto renew to the Permanent Missions to the United Nations the assurances of its highest \nconsideration. \n \n'"

Such \ninterns will not be permitted to obtain and enter the United States to participate in a \nUnited Nations internship program on a B-1 visa after this date. Any full-time interns \ncurrently in B-1 nonimmigrant status may complete their internship without seeking \na change of status, provided the internship will be completed no later than January 1, \n2020. If an internship will go beyond this date, the intern should apply for a change \nof status from B-1 to G-4 nonimmigrant status.  \n \nThe United States Mission to the United Nations notes that this policy change \nis intended to align United Nations interns with interns of other designated \ninternational organizations as well as interns temporarily assigned to missions to the \nUnited Nations. The Department of State will be updating guidance in the Foreign \nAffairs Manual accordingly to eliminate issuance of a B-1 visa for certain UN interns \nof \xe2\x80\x9cH1-B caliber\xe2\x80\x9d (9 FAM 402.3-7(D)(2)) and for participants in the United Nations \nInstitute for Training and Research (UNITAR) program (9 FAM 402.2-5(E)(6)).  \n \nThe United Nations Mission to the United Nations also reminds the United \nNations that a cable/note from the Chief of the Transportation Section, United Nations \nSecretariat is required for all United Nations officers and employees applying for a \nG-4 visa, including UN interns applying for a G-4 visa. G-4 visas are only available \nfor full-time interns at the United Nations Headquarters.  \n \nIn addition, the United States Mission to the United Nations reminds the United \nNations that interns applying for a G-4 visa must have a note that contains either \n(1) an express statement that the international organization considers the applicant its \nemployee during the internship, or (2) an acknowledgement that the international \norganization will exercise ultimate authority over the continuation of the intern\xe2\x80\x99s \nassignment and the control and direction of the official duties to be performed for the \nduration of the intern\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. assignment. This requirement may be met by submitting \na note from the appropriate United Nations office within the United Nations \nHeadquarters in New York to which the intern is to be assigned, to supplement the \ncable/note from the Transportation Office.  \n \nThe United Nations Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this \nopportunity to renew to the United Nations Secretariat the assurances of the highest \nconsideration. \n \n'"

The current \nminimum wage rate for Long Island and Westchester is $13, and in the remainder of New \nYork State it is $11.80 for each hour worked. The current minimum wage rate in the State \nof New York may be found online at the New York State Department of Labor website \n(https://www.labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/workprot/minwage.shtm).  \n \nIn accordance with New Jersey Statutes Annotated 34:11-56a4c, effective \n1 January 2020 and ending 31 December 2020, the State of New Jersey has updated \nits minimum wage to $10.30 for each hour worked for employers with less than six \nemployees. The current minimum wage rate and further information on scheduled \nincreases may be found online at the New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s Department Labor website \n(https://www.nj.gov/labor/wagehour/wagehour_index.html).  \n \nIn accordance with Connecticut General Statute \xc2\xa731-58, as amended by Public Act \n19-4, effective 1 October 2019, the Connecticut Department of Labor has increased its \nminimum wage to $11 for each hour worked. Public Law 19-4 includes additional future \nincreases in the minimum wage rate, including a scheduled increase to $12 per hour, \neffective 1 September 2020. The current minimum wage rate and further information on \nscheduled increases may be found online at the Connecticut Department of Labor \nwebsite (http://ctdol.state.ct.us/wgwkstnd/wage-hour/pay002.htm).  \n \nTherefore, domestic workers employed in residences in the States of \nConnecticut, New Jersey and New York, must be paid in accordance with the local \nminimum wage rates noted above. In addition, all new contracts between domestic \nworkers and their employers must reflect the updated wage amounts and all existing \ncontracts already in effect must be amended to reflect the updated wage amounts, with \nthe changes initialled by both the domestic worker and the employer. \n \n'"

Similarly, it may prove beneficial for the United \nNations Visa Committee to establish oversight and protection mechanisms, including \nby, inter alia, maintaining copies of employment contracts, and having the ability to \naccess payment records should any disputes arise between a United Nations staff \nmember and a domestic worker.  \n \nAt present, as a result of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) and current social distancing restrictions, the initial appointment for new \narrivals will be conducted either by telephone or video-conferencing with a member \nof the Host Country Affairs Office. Once the current restrictions are no longer in \nplace, the In-Person Registration Program will resume and the registration \nappointments will be held at the United States Mission to the United Nations.  \n \nAs notified in circular note HC-88-(S)-18, UN staff members must begin paying \ntheir domestic workers by check or electronic fund transfer within 30 days of the \ndomestic worker\xe2\x80\x99s arrival into the United States. If a United States bank account has \nnot yet been opened at the time of the registration appointment, the domestic worker \nwill be required to return to the United States Mission at a later date to provide the \nrequested information relating to the establishment of an account.  \n \nThe United States Mission recognizes that as this new programme is initiated, \nUnited Nations personnel may have questions related to programme and process \ndetails. For this reason, representatives of the United States Mission Host Country \nAffairs Office are available to respond to queries and provide support for a successful \npartnership with the United Nations community via the United Nations Visa \nCommittee on matters relating to the employment of domestic workers. Questions \nmay be directed to UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov. \n \nThe United States Mission and the United Nations community share common \ngoals in this endeavour, which include furthering collaboration in the obligation to \nprotect foreign domestic workers brought to the United States to work for United \nNations personnel. It is important to continue joint efforts to ensure that all domestic \nworkers understand their rights and protections, and that those employing these \nworkers understand their contractual obligations and responsibilities.  \n \n'"
