In the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Investing in the United  Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide"" (A/60/846), it was recalled that the  General Assembly, in section I of its resolution 60/260, had requested proposals to  specifically define accountability as well as clear accountability mechanisms,  including to the Assembly, and to propose clear parameters for its application and  the instruments for its rigorous enforcement, without exception, at all levels. It was  also indicated that: (a) the Assembly had recently addressed the issue of  accountability in its resolution 60/254, in which it took note of the report of the  Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations  (A/60/312); and (b) accountability arrangements would be discussed further in  future reports, including those addressing human resources and the administration of  justice. It was further pointed out that the overall strategy of strengthening capacity  in the area of information and communication technology, exercising limited  discretion in budget implementation, enhancing financial management arrangements  and improving reporting mechanisms contributes to greater accountability through  improved transparency in management systems.   2.  Views have since been shared that it would be helpful if further attention were  paid at this time to accountability issues, including a definition of accountability, so  that related proposals regarding budget implementation, financial management and  reporting mechanisms might be considered against the background of accountability  concepts, frameworks and mechanisms. The present report has been prepared to  facilitate such consideration in connection with the above-mentioned report, and in  particular the addenda thereto (A/60/846/Add.1-4). It has been prepared in the full  knowledge that, while there exist a multitude of accountability mechanisms and  procedures, there is a widespread perception that those mechanisms and procedures  have been of limited effectiveness to date. They require systematic and equitable  enforcement if in future the accountability system is to become a useful driver of  programme efficiency. The impact of many of the recently instituted accountability  measures of 2005 and 2006 has yet to be felt, as such measures are implemented one  step at a time. Further steps are to follow upon the completion of ongoing studies of  governance and oversight, human resources and the administration of justice.        II. Definition      3.  The call for a definition of accountability follows the use of the term by the  General Assembly in several different ways, in a variety of contexts and under  various agenda items in recent years. While the most recent report submitted by the  Secretary-General on the subject (A/60/312) was issued under the agenda items on  financial reports and audited financial statements and reports of the Board of  Auditors, and review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations, some of the earlier discussions have also taken  place under the agenda items on human resources management and United Nations  reform: measures and proposals.  4.  These considerations of accountability date back more than 10 years and have  resulted in the issuance of a number of reports that have shown that the term  ""accountability"" has been applied to two distinct aspects of the same issue. It has  been applied, on the one hand, to the broad responsibility of the Secretary-General  A/60/846/Add.6      4  06-39477    to Member States for the use of resources and the delivery of programmes and  services (results) and, on the other hand, more narrowly, for the responsibility of  individual staff members to the Secretary-General for performance of duties and  ethical conduct. Any acceptable definition of the concept of accountability in the  United Nations context would, therefore, need to take into account both the  institutional and the personal aspects of accountability as currently understood in  the Organization.  5.  While the Assembly has requested a definition of accountability, it is  understood that the request is for a working definition that may be applied in the  context of arrangements existing under the United Nations Charter. Accordingly,  definitions available from academic or legal sources and textbooks would require  adaptation before they could be adopted for general use in the United Nations. In  fact, the best definition of institutional accountability in the United Nations will  reflect the concrete arrangements put in place, with the approval of Member States,  for a framework to specify how the Secretary-General is held responsible for the use  of resources and delivery of results. This is achieved by the operation of a set of  transparent mechanisms that define the chain of responsibility and authority  downward from the level of the Secretary-General to all individual staff members  and specify the related reporting mechanisms upward from the lowest level of staff  back to the Secretary-General and onward to the intergovernmental level (see  annex I).  6.  The definition of personal accountability will reflect the requirement for an  individual staff member to explain and justify to his or her superior the performance  of his or her defined duties and responsibilities and also to be answerable for his or  her conduct, whether good or bad.  7.  The General Assembly may therefore wish to consider adopting the following  accountability definitions:    (a)  Institutional accountability: the responsibility of the Secretary-General to  explain and justify to the General Assembly and other relevant intergovernmental  bodies, in a systematic framework and by an orderly process using transparent  mechanisms, the performance of the Organization in using resources to achieve  results mandated by the Member States in the Assembly and/or other  intergovernmental bodies established under the Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  Personal accountability: the duty of an individual staff member to  exercise defined responsibilities appropriately, with a clear understanding of the  consequences, and to explain and justify to the official who conferred the authority  the results achieved and the manner in which the authority has been exercised.        III. Chain of responsibility, authority and accountability      8.  As described in earlier reports on accountability, the chain of responsibility,  authority and accountability flows institutionally from the intergovernmental organs  to the Secretary-General and personally to managers and staff members. Under  Article 97 of the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization; the mandates promulgated by the principal organs are entrusted to  him for their implementation under Article 98. The Secretary-General is therefore  accountable to the Member States for the implementation of those mandates. The    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  5    Secretary-General's discretion as chief administrative officer is governed by Articles  100 and 101 of the Charter and by the staff, financial and programme planning  regulations adopted by the General Assembly. His managerial discretion is exercised  under the mandates given to him collectively by Member States and with the  resources they make available to carry out those mandates. The responsibilities of  Member States are also specified in many of those legislative mandates and, where  specialized intergovernmental bodies are concerned, in their terms of reference.  9.  A comprehensive system of accountability is based on the premises that  responsibility must be clearly defined, managers and staff must have the resources,  capacity and authority to carry out their respective responsibilities, and  accountability must be established at all levels through appropriate mechanisms.  Such an accountability system has existed within the Organization for many years  and has been described, updated and discussed in a number of reports of the  Secretary-General, the most recent being his report on measures to strengthen  accountability at the United Nations (A/60/312). As is the case with most systems  and the related measures and processes for implementation, full compliance and  effectiveness require awareness, understanding, knowledge and timely application.  An important element of the accountability system is the reporting requirement  whereby Member States are kept informed of the management of the Organization's  programmes and financial and human resources. Such transparent reporting allows  Member States to provide policy direction, to review the status and effectiveness of  implementation, to consider the continuing validity of mandates and to take  decisions on future action to be taken by both Member States and the Secretary- General.  10. Recent enhancements to the accountability system within the Secretariat  include, for example, the implementation of results-based management; the  establishment of the Management Performance Board in 2005, the Ethics Office in  2006 and the Oversight Committee in 2005; enhancement of the Performance  Appraisal System; protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct in 2006;  the expanded and strengthened financial disclosure requirements in 2006; improved  performance data; and expansion of training for all levels of staff. Beyond the  Secretariat, the General Assembly, pursuant to its resolution 60/1, decided to  establish the Independent Audit Advisory Committee to assist it in discharging its  oversight responsibilities and, in its resolution 60/248, requested terms of reference  and related resource requirements. This is a key strategic change which, once fully  implemented, will greatly improve the quality of auditing as a core component of  the Assembly's oversight of the Organization. Such measures and others already  described in previous reports are intended to ensure that the legislative mandates are  implemented in the most effective and efficient manner.   11. Elements of an effective accountability system, summarizing earlier reports  and hereby updated, include:     (a)  A clearly defined institutional/governance framework. Such a framework  includes the Charter; legislative mandates (emanating from principal and subsidiary  bodies); and staff, financial and programme planning regulations and rules, policies  and procedures. In this connection, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/1,  the question of governance and oversight is currently being addressed by an  independent external evaluation, which will include measures to further strengthen  the governance and oversight framework, particularly with regard to the operation  A/60/846/Add.6      6  06-39477    of results-based management and related programme monitoring and evaluation  activities; the results of the evaluation will be transmitted by the Secretary-General  to the General Assembly. Within the institutional/governance framework, the  Secretary-General is institutionally accountable to Member States; all other staff  members are personally accountable to the Secretary-General;    (b)  A clear definition of responsibility and authority and results to be  achieved. This includes a determination of which staff members are responsible for  what, what they are meant to do and achieve and within what regulations and rules;  and clear objectives, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement. In  this connection, some of the recent measures effected in 2005 and 2006 include the  following:     (i)  Establishment of executive decision-making committees (see annex II);    (ii) A mandatory induction framework for senior managers;     (iii) An improved senior management compact;     (iv) An enhanced Performance Appraisal System;     (v)  Ethics training;     (vi) Access to information concerning decisions of the Secretary-General in  disciplinary matters;    (c)  Adequate resources and tools to implement mandates. This element of  the accountability system requires payment by Member States of assessments on  time, in full and without conditions; effective management tools (plans, budgets,  monitoring and evaluation); and effective human resources management;    (d)  Effective monitoring and oversight of programme, budgetary and staff  performance. The effective measurement of programme delivery and achievement  of results requires:    (i)  Effective oversight mechanisms (Management Performance Board,  Oversight Committee,  Office of Internal Oversight Services, Board of  Auditors, Joint Inspection Unit);    (ii) Effective internal controls (control environment, risk assessment, control  activities, information, communication and monitoring);    (iii) Improvements in monitoring and self-evaluation, including updating and  upgrading monitoring and evaluation tools;    (iv) Enhanced  accounting  standards,  as  proposed  in  document  A/60/846/Add.3, through the adoption of the International Public Sector  Accounting Standards;    (v)  Enhanced Performance Appraisal System;    (vi) Ensuring ethical conduct, financial disclosure and whistle-blower  protection;    (e)  Effective follow-up and clear, meaningful consequences. This element  requires effective measures and sanctions for dealing with non-compliance and with  poor performance, underperformance and non-performance. In this connection, the    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  7    administration of justice Redesign Panel will be submitting its recommendations to  the General Assembly at the sixty-first session.  12. In implementing the accountability system, the Secretary-General expresses  his accountability to Member States in reports submitted to them, as representatives  of the principal organs of the United Nations or as representatives of the subsidiary  intergovernmental bodies. Member States in turn exercise their oversight  responsibility for programme performance and take decisions thereon. Programme  managers are personally accountable to the Secretary-General, who exercises his  responsibility for ensuring programme monitoring and improving staff performance.        IV. Accountability for results       13. The work of the Organization is conducted pursuant to legislative mandates  adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social  Council and their subsidiary bodies. For the regular budget, those legislative  mandates are translated into programmes and subprogrammes, which are formulated  in accordance with the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the  Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8). The strategic framework serves as the  basis for the formulation of the biennial programme budgets. The Secretary-General  monitors the delivery of outputs and the achievement of expected accomplishments.  The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning also provide that all  programmed activities shall be evaluated. With respect to peacekeeping operations,  the development, review, approval and administration of their budgets follow  similar results-based budgetary and implementation procedures.  14. The Secretary-General is thus institutionally accountable to Member States for  the proper management of the Organization and the implementation of its mandated  programmes and activities. The Secretary-General delegates authority to senior  officials who are, in turn, personally accountable to him. There are reporting  requirements throughout the cycle of planning, budgeting, implementation,  monitoring and evaluation of activities, and Member States have the opportunity to  hold the Secretary-General accountable for actions taken to implement legislative  mandates. Reporting requirements include status or progress reports on  implementation, programme and budget performance reports, specific reports  requested by intergovernmental bodies and evaluations of the work of the  Organization to determine relevance, efficiency and effectiveness. In this  connection, in addition to reporting requirements with respect to elements of the  programme planning cycle, the Management Performance Board and the Oversight  Committee, both of which were established in 2005, are expected to monitor the  manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been  delegated to them with respect to programme management, including financial and  human resources management, and to report thereon to the Secretary-General (see  annex III).  15. Member States exercise their oversight responsibility by holding the Secretary- General accountable for the achievement of measurable results. This in turn requires  a management culture that focuses on attaining clearly articulated objectives  through the achievement of results. Good performance indicators are essential for  measuring whether or not the expected results were achieved. These elements are  A/60/846/Add.6      8  06-39477    fundamental for results-based management, the full implementation of which will  represent a significant step towards reaching the goal of accountability.   16. The challenges facing the Organization with respect to the effective  management of programmes include the enhancement of results-based management,  the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation activities and the improvement of  internal controls. Training and certification of acquired skills and knowledge are key  to ensuring more effective implementation of programmes.  17. It is noted that the programme evaluation system is separate and distinct from  the personnel performance appraisal system. Since the programme evaluation  system is concerned with programme effectiveness and impact rather than the  performance of individual staff members, no information shall be transmitted  between the two systems (Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning,  rule 107.3 (c)). At the same time, the Management Performance Board, in addition  to assessing the functioning of individual departments and offices and the manner in  which they discharge their responsibilities, will be holding senior managers  accountable should problems arise.         V. Accountability for management of financial resources      18. As mentioned above, there is a system in place, including regulations and  rules, for the planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of the Organization's  programmes and activities. Once the budgets are approved by the General Assembly,  authorization to incur expenditures is issued under the authority of the Controller in  the form of allotment advices, including staffing table authorizations. Various  administrative instructions set out the procedures and norms governing the different  items of expenditure. Extrabudgetary resources are subject to the same financial  management systems as those provided under assessed budgets.   19. The Financial Rules establish a clear and hierarchical structure in the  delegation of authority. The Secretary-General delegates authority and responsibility  for the implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules to the Under- Secretary-General for Management, who in turn formally and publicly delegates this  authority to the Controller, except for the implementation of the Financial  Regulations pertaining to procurement and property management, which are  normally delegated to the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  The Controller and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services  delegate some carefully defined aspects of their authority to the executive officers  of departments and to heads of administration in offices away from Headquarters.  Delegation of authority is done on a personal basis and not by virtue of the office  held by the staff member. Financial or procurement authority can be further  delegated by the executive officers or heads of administration, but the Controller  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services remain ultimately  accountable for its use. Delegation of authority is always done in writing and signed  by those to whom the authority has been delegated. In this connection, it is  recognized explicitly in the Financial Rules that accountability does not abrogate the  responsibility of those delegating authority. Exercise of delegated authority requires  the competency, knowledge and skills to ensure full compliance with the  instruments for internal controls. In this connection, greater attention will need to be  given in future to the timely issuance of guidelines, mandatory training and    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  9    certification of acquired knowledge and skills in order to strengthen accountability  for financial management.  20. The internal financial control systems of the Organization are based on the  concept of checks and balances, fundamental to which is the segregation of duties,  so that transactions require approval and scrutiny by more than one individual. The  internal control system entails the designation of staff with certifying or approving  authority; other staff are responsible for signing cheques, operating bank accounts  and effecting payments. The financial and staff regulations and rules contain explicit  provisions to protect the Organization against any financial loss that might result  from a staff member's violation of such rules. Financial rule 101.2 reads:    All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who  contravenes  the  Financial  Regulations  and  Rules  or  corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions.   In this connection, an administrative instruction was issued (ST/AI/2004/3) for the  purpose of implementing the provisions of financial rule 101.2 and staff rules 112.3,  212.2 and 312.2, detailing the conditions under which staff members may be  required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial  loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of the staff member's gross  negligence or of his or her having violated any regulation, rule or administrative  instruction.   21. During any financial period the Secretary-General's accountability to Member  States for the management of financial resources is reflected in the ongoing reports  Member States receive on financial and budgetary issues, including reports on the  financial situation, financial statements, audits, resource requirements, budget  performance, statements of programme budget implications and other reports as  requested by Member States, to facilitate their decision-making on the utilization  and prudent stewardship of the funds of the Organization. Financial and programme  adjustments are reported to Member States for approval.   22. Member States, through examination by the Office of Internal Oversight  Services of compliance with policies, also hold the Secretary-General accountable  for the safeguarding of assets, the economical and efficient use of resources and the  effectiveness of programme performance. Similarly, Member States, through the  work of the United Nations Board of Auditors, hold the Secretary-General  accountable for the quality and accuracy of the accounts of the United Nations.        VI. Accountability for management of human resources      23. Under the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization (Article 97). He has the authority to appoint staff under regulations  established by the General Assembly (Article 101, para. 1). In the appointment of  staff and the determination of the conditions of service, the paramount consideration  is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity, with due regard paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a  geographical basis as possible (ibid., para. 3).  A/60/846/Add.6      10  06-39477    24. The authority to select staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is delegated  to heads of departments and offices, who are accountable to the Secretary-General  for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Under the staff selection  system, which applies to staff appointed under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, the  authority is exercised under the scrutiny of a central review body, which will ensure  that the process leading to the decision was properly followed.  25. The authority to administer staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is  delegated to senior officials who are personally accountable to the Secretary- General for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Those senior officials  may further delegate the exercise of elements of their own authority to other  officials, who will be answerable to them for the manner in which they performed  their functions.  26. Staff regulation 1.3 provides that staff members are accountable to the  Secretary-General for the proper discharge of their functions. Staff members are  required to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in  the discharge of their functions, and their performance is appraised periodically to  ensure that the required standards of performance are met.   27. Department heads submit to the Secretary-General a senior management  compact, which includes, in addition to programmatic and financial objectives,  specific human resources objectives and targets agreed upon by the department head  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management. The Office  of Human Resources Management is responsible for monitoring progress made  towards achievement of those objectives and targets. The Management Performance  Board is responsible for monitoring the manner in which senior managers exercise  all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their  performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans.  28. All other staff, up to and including those at the Assistant Secretary-General  level,1 are covered by the performance appraisal system (PAS). A key feature of  PAS is a clear definition at the beginning of the performance year by the staff  member and his or her supervisor of work objectives and associated performance  indicators. PAS has a midterm review and a year-end appraisal, at which point  performance is evaluated using the performance indicators defined at the beginning  of the year. Another key feature of PAS is that it assesses how staff demonstrate the  Organization's core values and competencies. All managers are evaluated against  the requisite managerial competencies.  29. Another important dimension of accountability is that all staff members,  regardless of level, are held to the basic obligations of proper conduct defined in  article 1 of the Staff Regulations and chapter 1 of the Staff Rules and are subject to  disciplinary measures when misconduct is established.   30. With respect to the accountability of the Secretary-General to Member States  for the management of human resources in the context of policies determined by the  General Assembly, reports on human resources management are submitted to the  Assembly on a regular basis for consideration, overall direction and decision- making. As requested by the Assembly in its resolution 60/260, further details on the  accountability mechanisms in respect of the Secretary-General's reform proposals  __________________    1  The governance and oversight evaluation is recommending that this be extended to the Under- Secretaries-General.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  11    relating to human resources management will be submitted to the Assembly at its  sixty-first session in the context of a detailed report to be provided in respect of the  human resources aspects of the report of the Secretary-General on investing in the  United Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide (A/60/692 and Corr.1).        VII. Accountability for management of procurement      31. The Secretary-General, in his report on procurement reform (A/60/846/Add.5),  has described concrete measures for implementing procurement reform focusing on  strengthening internal control measures, optimizing United Nations acquisition and  procurement management so as to reduce acquisition costs and strategic  management of United Nations procurement. These measures are aimed at  enhancing responsibility and accountability by promoting ethics and integrity in the  workplace (whistle-blower protection policy, training in ethics, Supplier Code of  Conduct, independent Bid Protest System), strengthening training programmes,  updating and/or modifying procurement processes (updated procurement manual,  improved terms and conditions for tenders, vendor roster, ex post facto cases) and  enhancing governance (risk management, contract compliance, oversight).  32. Delegation of authority, which does not abrogate the responsibility of the  official delegating the authority, for procurement activities needs to be closely  monitored. In this respect, authority is delegated formally to staff responsible for  procurement. The Secretariat will terminate such authority should serious flaws in  its exercise be discovered. At the same time, disciplinary measures are taken  wherever and whenever necessary based on established procedures currently in  place.  33. It should be noted that accountability for procurement activities does not rest  solely with procurement officers but also with requisitioners, who also need to be  fully trained and made aware of proper procurement practices. It is the  responsibility of requisitioners to have proper procurement plans so that actions for  the acquisition of goods and services can be taken on a timely basis and programme  results can be achieved in a cost-effective manner. The Secretariat has been  monitoring actions taken by requisitioners and continues to draw to their attention  instances where procurement procedures are not adhered to. For any serious breach  of conduct, disciplinary measures are taken, as appropriate.   34. The Secretariat continues to bring procurement staff at Headquarters and in the  field up to date on the concerns expressed by Members and by the auditors. In  addition to sharing knowledge and experience, there is a need to enhance training in  procurement-related activities throughout the Secretariat, which the Secretariat  plans to do. It is necessary to ensure that staff assigned to procurement activities  have the requisite knowledge and skills prior to assuming those responsibilities. In  this respect, the Secretariat ensures that new staff being recruited for procurement  functions have appropriate procurement experience and the necessary educational  background, preferably with certification in procurement. The Secretariat plans to  increase such procurement certification opportunities for current staff members as  well. Procurement staff assigned to field missions are technically cleared by the  Procurement Service prior to assignment.  35. One of the prerequisites for carrying out procurement activities in offices away  from Headquarters and in peacekeeping operations, outside the Procurement  A/60/846/Add.6      12  06-39477    Service, is the establishment of an adequate local capacity consisting of trained and  experienced officers. Once such capacity is fully established, procurement authority  may safely be delegated to offices and missions. Currently, the instrument of  delegation gives blanket authority to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,  which is then further delegated to individual procurement officers in the field. This  procedure is under review to determine whether a more focused arrangement would  be preferable in future to provide for sounder internal controls on procurement.        VIII. Conclusions and recommendations      36. Starting with the Charter, which sets out the purposes and principles of the  United Nations, there are many instruments that guide the work of the Organization- legislative mandates, regulations and rules, policies and procedures, administrative  issuances, guidelines, instructions, oversight and review bodies, and performance  standards. In addition, there are reporting requirements of Member States to address  issues related to the management of programmes, procurement and financial and  human resources. While such instruments provide legitimacy for the conduct of  business, they also impose limitations on the way the Secretariat performs its duties.  With the increase in field operations, as well as their complexity, there is an urgent  need to find better ways to balance the timely implementation of Security Council  and General Assembly mandates and the fulfilment of all procedural requirements.  It is important to have effective controls, and it is equally important to encourage  greater initiative and innovation in order to manage better and in a more timely  manner. An appropriate balance between the overall policy guidance from Member  States and the exercise of managerial discretion by the Secretary-General is  essential for meeting today's multifaceted and complex challenges in a timely and  effective manner.   37. The assumption of responsibility, and being held accountable for the  performance of functions and duties, require an awareness, understanding and  knowledge of the nature and scope of the regulatory framework. It is essential that  staff are well equipped to ensure compliance within that framework. To that end the  Secretariat will not only enhance, and enforce where applicable, training  programmes, but will also require in future certification of knowledge and skills  acquired for the performance of functions in the areas of finance, procurement and  human resources management.   38. Accountability should be viewed not only from the perspective of possible  malfeasance, but also from the perspective of competencies for programme  performance. Little attention has been given, within the Secretariat or by  intergovernmental bodies, to holding the Secretariat accountable for the  achievement of results. In reviewing programmes of work, the focus has been too  much on the pre-implementation stage and, unless there are glaring errors, fraud or  corruption, which inevitably draw attention, little time is given to determining  whether or not results were achieved and, if not, why not. Measures exist to deal  with inappropriate behaviour, negligence, and gross negligence, and they need little  enhancement. Measures to determine the adequacy of results achieved, the  soundness of management of results, financial and human resources, and  procurement and subsequent action to hold staff accountable are probably  insufficient, however.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  13    39. The General Assembly has repeatedly stressed the importance of strengthened  accountability and of ensuring greater accountability of the Secretary-General to  Member States for the efficient and effective implementation of legislative  mandates. Measures that have been put in place to ensure accountability for the  management of programmes and of financial and human resources have been  described in a number of reports over the past 10 years or so, the most recent being  the report of the Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the  United Nations (A/60/312). Follow-up action in implementing those measures has,  however, not been comprehensive. There is currently limited understanding of the  consequences of underperformance, poor performance, or non-performance. There  are currently no sanctions for the non-achievement of expected results. The  oversight of performance within the Secretariat rests on the shoulders of staff who  are appointed to sit on boards, panels and committees to undertake such reviews in  addition to their regular functions. It is not surprising that such oversight functions  are given lower priority when more urgent situations arise requiring immediate  attention.  40. A transparent and effective system of accountability and responsibility  demands more than setting out or revising procedures, regulations and rules. An  important element in the system is the continued promotion of a management  culture that encourages improved performance, higher levels of productivity and  better quality of work. Ethical behaviour and compliance with the standards of  conduct in the international civil service are required, as is an ongoing flow of  information within and among departments so that officials are fully aware, on a  continuing basis, of their respective responsibilities, particularly since coordination  and collaboration are essential for the implementation of many mandates.  41. As indicated above, details on accountability for human resources management  and in relation to results-based management will be addressed in the reports on  reform of human resources management and on governance and oversight  respectively, to be submitted to the General Assembly later this year.  42. The General Assembly may wish to:    (a)  Welcome the present report and endorse the definitions of  accountability provided in paragraph 7 above;    (b)  Note that a sound legal framework for accountability exists in the  United Nations, consisting of, inter alia:    (i)  The Charter;    (ii) The Financial Regulations and Rules;    (iii) The Staff Regulations and Rules;    (iv) The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and  the Methods of Evaluation;    (v)  The rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which specify the  duties of the Secretary-General and of the Secretariat;    (vi) Procedures set out in regulations and rules, as well as in a substantial  number of General Assembly resolutions, which govern reporting by the  Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the use of financial and  A/60/846/Add.6      14  06-39477    human resources and on results-based programme implementation,  including monitoring and evaluation;    (vii) Procedures governing the reporting to the General Assembly by  oversight bodies, including the Board of Auditors and the Office of  Internal Oversight Services;    (c)  Note that the accountability framework of the United Nations has  been strengthened in 2005 and 2006 through:    (i)  The establishment of the Ethics Office and the provision of  systematic mandatory ethics training for staff;    (ii) Protection against harassment and retaliation for reporting  misconduct;    (iii) Strengthened financial disclosure requirements;    (iv) The establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee;    (v)  The establishment of the Management Performance Board to hold  senior officials accountable for the conduct of their functions;    (vi) The establishment of the Oversight Committee to strengthen  compliance with approved audit and oversight recommendations;    (vii) The establishment of executive decision-making committees;    (d)  Note that further enhancements to the United Nations accountability  system may be anticipated in the light of recommendations expected from the  ongoing review of United Nations governance and oversight and of the internal  justice system;    (e)  Request the Secretary-General to continue strengthening the  effectiveness of the accountability system through:    (i)  Improvements in results-based budgeting and management;    (ii) Ensuring that sanctions in the accountability system are applied  through rigorous enforcement without exception at all levels;    (iii) Ensuring that adequate incentives are in place to reward good  performance.

Accountability  includes achievement of objectives and results in response to mandates, fair and  accurate reporting on performance results, stewardship of funds, and all aspects of  performance in accordance with regulations, rules and standards, including a clearly  defined system of rewards and sanctions.    The present report is submitted in response to General Assembly resolution  63/276, in which Member States requested the Secretary-General to submit a  comprehensive report on accountability, including on 11 specific topics. In addition  to a proposed definition of the term ""accountability"", the report includes eight  recommendations for strengthening accountability in the United Nations Secretariat,  which are presented in the relevant sections and in a complete list at the end of the  report. Annex I contains a description of the current accountability system in the  United Nations Secretariat. Annex II proposes a detailed plan and road map for the  implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal control framework.  Annex III provides the response of management to address flaws in internal  monitoring, inspection and accountability regarding the management of the oil-for- food programme.    The Secretary-General requests the General Assembly to endorse the  components of the accountability system for the Secretariat as described in the  present report and the related measures for increased accountability.

Introduction      1.  The present report is submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to resolution  63/276. It responds in particular to the issues raised in paragraph 9 of the resolution,  which are listed below and which, for ease of reference, form the basic structure of  this report:    (a)  Definition of accountability and roles and responsibilities;    (b)  Performance reporting;    (c)  Implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies;    (d)  Personal and institutional accountability;    (e)  Selection and appointment of senior managers;    (f)  Reform of the performance appraisal system;    (g)  Delegation of authority;    (h)  Implementation of the results-based management framework;     (i)  Results-based management information system;    (j)  Enterprise risk management and internal control framework;    (k)  How the current and proposed accountability mechanisms would have  addressed the flaws in the management of the oil-for-food programme.  2.  In the past four years, the Secretariat has submitted three reports on  accountability in the United Nations Secretariat,1 in which governance and  oversight in the United Nations was reviewed and the larger accountability  framework of the Secretariat was discussed. I share the belief of Member States that  accountability is a central pillar of effective and efficient management that requires  attention at the highest level. I wish to reiterate that I remain fully committed to  advancing the capacity of the Organization in this regard. I also note the significant  progress that has been made on accountability matters in recent years. Achievements  include the establishment of the Ethics Office of the United Nations Secretariat; the  promulgation of an effective whistleblower protection policy; the implementation of  a rigorous financial disclosure programme; the introduction of a new internal justice  system; and the strengthening of the independent oversight bodies, including the  establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. The Secretariat has  also been working constantly to increase its accountability for delivering results, at  both the staff and organizational levels, for example by publishing the compacts of  senior managers and the annual assessments of their performance towards achieving  the objectives contained therein, as well as issuing and publishing on the Secretariat  Intranet an interim programme performance report covering the first year of the  biennium 2008-2009.   __________________    1 Report of the Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations  (A/60/312); report of the Secretary-General on the comprehensive review of governance and  oversight within the United Nations and its funds, programmes and specialized agencies  (A/60/883 and Add.1 and 2 and Add.1/Corr.1; and report of the Secretary-General on an  accountability framework, enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and  results-based management framework (A/62/701 and Corr.1 and Add.1).  A/64/640      10-22371  4    3.  Nevertheless, more remains to be done. General Assembly resolution  63/276 requires me to present clear measures and make concrete proposals on a  range of issues. Wherever possible, I offer such recommendations in the present  report and provide information on the most relevant actions taken at the strategic  and policy level on matters under my purview since the issuance of my previous  report (A/62/701 and Corr.1).  4.  In some instances, however, I believe it is important to take a step back and  review the existing structures, both in their ideal and current state, to better  understand the foundation on which the organizational accountability system rests.  The planning and reporting documents, in particular the strategic framework, the  programme budget, the peacekeeping budgets and the performance reports,  constitute a sine qua non for effective accountability. We need to forge a clear and  common understanding of the expected accomplishments and objectives that  Member States set for the Organization in order to align the processes, outputs and  services of the Secretariat. Without the programme, planning and budget documents  effectively guiding the way, other improvements further downstream may fall short  of expectations.  5.  In the present report, I outline the weaknesses of existing structures and  suggest how they might be remedied. For ease of reference and to put these  recommendations in context, I have included an overview of the current  accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat in annex I. A detailed plan  and road map for the implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework that I propose is contained in annex II. Annex III contains an  overview of the actions taken by the Secretariat to strengthen its accountability  mechanisms in response to the weaknesses identified by the Independent Inquiry  Committee in terms of internal monitoring, inspection and accountability regarding  the management of the oil-for-food programme.   6.  The challenge before us is formidable: strengthening an accountability system  in an organization as complex as the United Nations is a daunting task and a  continuous process. There is no predetermined finishing line and no set path on how  best to proceed, as objectives and standards are likely to evolve over time in a  system that itself keeps changing to meet the growing needs of the Organization. All  stakeholders must work together in defining the components of our joint  accountability system, identifying the areas that need strengthening and committing  themselves to a process of continuous improvement.  7.  As part of the consultation process I initiated in preparation for the present  report, the Secretariat over the course of three months held more than 15 informal  meetings with Member States, senior staff of the Secretariat and representatives  from the United Nations system to discuss its content. The present report captures  the essence of the ideas raised in our exchanges that related to the issue of  accountability. It is my sincere hope that the report will help to advance our ongoing  dialogue and move us forward on the path towards a more accountable United  Nations.     A/64/640   5  10-22371      II. Issues raised in paragraph 9 of General Assembly   resolution 63/276        A. Definition of accountability and roles and responsibilities      8.  The basic principles that provide the framework for accountability at the  United Nations are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which stipulates  the purposes and principles of the United Nations and identifies the principal organs  and their roles and responsibilities.   9.  Under the Charter, it is the prerogative of Member States to provide mandates  to the Secretariat through the resolutions and decisions emanating from the United  Nations principal organs. Further, the Charter establishes that the Secretary-General  is the Chief Administrative Officer of the United Nations (Article 97) and that the  mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United Nations are entrusted to  him for implementation (Article 98). Accordingly, the Secretary-General is  accountable to the Member States for the implementation of those mandates.   10. Pursuant to resolution 63/276, and after considering definitions of  accountability by other United Nations entities,2 I would like to propose the  following definition:     Accountability is the obligation of the Organization and its staff members to  be answerable for delivering specific results that have been determined  through a clear and transparent assignment of responsibility, subject to the  availability of resources and the constraints posed by external factors.  Accountability includes achieving objectives and results in response to  mandates, fair and accurate reporting on performance results, stewardship of  funds, and all aspects of performance in accordance with regulations, rules and  standards, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions.  11. Applied to the context of the United Nations, I understand this definition to  imply a number of obligations for the United Nations Secretariat, namely:    (a)  To conduct its work with a view to achieving the objectives and results  established through clear mandates of Member States;     (b)  To report fairly and accurately on performance results vis-a-vis mandated  roles, plans and activities;    (c)  To conduct its work in accordance with United Nations regulations, rules  and procedures;  __________________    2  The United Nations Development Programme uses the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development definition of accountability, which is ""the obligation to demonstrate that work  has been conducted in compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and  accurately on performance results vis-a-vis mandated roles and/or plans"". The definition by the  United Nations Population Fund is as follows: ""Accountability is the process whereby public  service organizations and individuals within them are held responsible for their decisions and  actions, including their stewardship of public funds, fairness, and all aspects of performance, in  accordance with agreed rules and standards, and fair and accurate reporting on performance  results vis-a-vis mandated roles and/or plans."" The United Nations Children's Fund uses the  following definition: ""Accountability is the obligation to demonstrate that work has been  conducted in accordance with agreed rules and standards, and that performance results have  been reported fairly and accurately.""  A/64/640      10-22371  6      (d)  To ensure that staff members adhere to the highest level of integrity and  ethical standards expected of an international civil servant;     (e)  To clearly specify and enforce a system of rewards for outstanding  performance and sanctions for non-performance.  12. The point of departure for operationalizing the concept of accountability is the  agreement, in essence a covenant, between Member States and the Secretariat  expressed in the strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping  budgets. Member States provide the mandates for what the United Nations aspires to  achieve in a given cycle with the resources appropriated. The Secretariat is obliged  to deliver the results established thereby, subject to availability of resources and  constraints posed by external factors beyond its control.   13. These objectives and results are obtained, inter alia, through the work of its  staff, who are obliged to adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct. In this  process, the Secretariat is required to respect rules and regulations and to follow a  set of procedures that guarantee its proper functioning. The internal and external  oversight bodies seek to provide assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of  these processes through independent and objective assessment.  14. The accountability structure of the Organization rests on six components:     (a)  The Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  The strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping  budgets (the covenant);     (c)  Delivery of results and performance (including a system of rewards and  sanctions);     (d)  Internal systems and controls;     (e)  Ethical standards and integrity;     (f)  Oversight roles and functions.  15. The interrelationships among these components and in  the larger  accountability structure of the Secretariat are reflected in the chart below.                             A/64/640   7  10-22371        Figure   Accountability structure                                              16. It is my sincere hope that the broad consultations held by the Secretariat in  preparation for the present report have forged a common understanding of the  existing structures and will allow the Organization to take the above definition of  accountability as an agreed point of departure for future efforts to strengthen  accountability in the Secretariat.3         B. Performance reporting      17. The Secretariat reports its performance to the General Assembly in the context  of the established objectives of programme budgets at the end of every biennium (or  the budget year) through the programme performance report, or in the case of  departments and offices funded by the support account and peacekeeping missions,  through annual performance reports. The programme performance report contains a  description of progress towards achieving objectives and expected accomplishments  by each programme, as well as explanations for any deviations or lack of progress  where applicable.   __________________    3  For a detailed description of the components of the current accountability system, see annex I.          A/64/640      10-22371  8    18. Over the years, the General Assembly has made a number of recommendations  on the format of the programme performance report and the support account and  peacekeeping mission annual performance reports. These recommendations call for  a better qualitative assessment of programme implementation and for reporting that  is more closely aligned with the objectives, expected accomplishments and  indicators of achievement (see resolution 61/235 and 59/275).   19. To strengthen the quality of performance reporting, three systemic issues need  to be addressed:     (a)  The formulation of the logical frameworks;    (b)  The timing of the issuance of programme performance reports;     (c)  The capacity of the current management information systems to link  results achieved to resources used.   20. The logical frameworks that are at the core of the programme planning and  budgeting process are sometimes poorly formulated. The broad strategic objectives  and priorities of the Organization are often not linked to those at the lower levels  and are not clearly formulated or attainable. Expected accomplishments and  associated indicators of achievement are sometimes formulated at the level of  activities and outputs and do not necessarily lend themselves to the achievement of  established objectives. Indicators of achievement do not always constitute  meaningful performance measures. External factors are not based on an appropriate  risk assessment.4  21. Issuing the programme performance report at the end of the first quarter of the  year following the biennium reduces its usefulness to Member States for budgetary  decision-making, as it becomes available only after decisions have already been  taken in relation to the next biennium. I note that the assessment presented by the  Secretariat to Member States at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly  still stands: that ""the existing systems for reporting and evaluating the performance  of programmes have no practical impact on future plans and resource allocation  decisions"" (A/57/387 and Corr.1, para. 164).   22. Finally, the current information management systems do not link information  on results to resources used at the programme or subprogramme levels. This  disconnect renders it difficult for Member States to estimate the costs associated  with implementing mandates or reaching specific results. A tool to address this  issue, a results-based management module, will be included in the Umoja  (enterprise resource planning) system.  __________________    4  Some of these weaknesses have been described in previous reports of the Secretary-General and  the oversight bodies, such as the report of the Secretary-General on an accountability  framework, enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and results-based  management framework (A/62/701 and Corr.1); the report of the Office of Internal Oversight  Services on its review of results-based management at the United Nations (A/63/268), which  concluded that ""Results-based management at the United Nations has been an administrative  chore of little value to accountability and decision-making""; the report of the Joint Inspection  Unit on an evaluation of results-based budgeting in peacekeeping operations (JIU/REP/2006/1,  see A/60/709); and the series of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on managing for results in  the United Nations system (JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7,  JIU/REP/2004/8 and JIU/REP/2006/6, see A/59/607, A/59/617, A/59/631, A/59/632 and  A/61/805).    A/64/640   9  10-22371        Recommendation      To enable more performance-informed decision-making by Member States  regarding programme plans and budgets, I produced as a pilot an interim  programme performance report covering the first year of the biennium  2008-2009. I propose to supplement the comprehensive biennial  programme performance report with an interim report on the progress  made by the Secretariat towards achievement of expected results at the  end of the first year of each biennium.   23. It should be noted, however, that the implementation of this recommendation  would be most effective if the underlying problems with the logical frameworks, on  which the programme performance report is based, could first be addressed, so that  the information provided through the report would help Member States to determine  whether the Organization is meeting its objectives.        Recommendation      I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja (enterprise resource planning) project, which incorporates, inter alia,  the development of interoperable information management tools needed to  effectively support results-based budgeting and eventually results-based  management.         C. Implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies      24. Oversight bodies have an important role to play in promoting a culture of  compliance and integrity and in deterring mismanagement. They provide critical  support to managers by independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of  internal systems and controls. It is my firm belief that an important responsibility of  managers in the Organization is to implement all accepted recommendations of the  oversight bodies. The Management Committee has been charged with overseeing  compliance in this regard.5   25. The Department of Management monitors departmental implementation of  oversight recommendations and reports the implementation status to the  Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The reports of the oversight bodies are  also provided to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the General Assembly.  In addition, the budget fascicles include a section reflecting actions taken by  departments in response to oversight recommendations. This enables Member States  to make informed decisions with regard to the accomplishments of the Organization  and its level of compliance with rules, policies and procedures.  26. The Organization is fully committed to implementing the recommendations of  the oversight bodies. I am pleased to report that we are beginning to see a positive  __________________    5  In order to ensure timely implementation of oversight body recommendations, the Secretariat  added to the core functions of the Management Committee the responsibility to ""ensure that  findings and recommendations of the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Office  of Internal Oversight Services are effectively fed into the executive management processes, and  that accepted recommendations are followed up and implemented in a timely manner""  (ST/SGB/2006/14).  A/64/640      10-22371  10    trend in the rate of implementation of such recommendations. It should be noted that  there is a formal process by which recommendations are accepted or not by  management. When they are not accepted, the relevant manager must provide a  compelling explanation for non-acceptance. It might be that the oversight body  insists on the need to implement these recommendations. In cases where  management and the relevant oversight body continue to disagree, the case is raised  to the Management Committee for a decision. To allow the Management Committee  to take an informed decision and determine a possible course of action, I intend to  require a mandatory risk assessment of the potential impact of non-acceptance of a  recommendation. This assessment will be done in the context of the proposed  enterprise risk management framework, as described in section J of the present  report. I shall emphasize that the responsibility for the risk of non-implementation  rests with management.  27. In keeping with the high premium I and Member States place on the timely  implementation of oversight recommendations, and to improve the management of  the Organization in this critical area, the Management Committee in 2009 initiated a  more direct engagement and strengthened dialogue with all the oversight bodies.  ""Dialogue meetings"" were held in 2009 with the Board of Auditors, the Office of  Internal Oversight Services and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. In  early 2010, the Committee will meet with the Joint Inspection Unit.   28. These meetings were the first time that senior management had directly  engaged the oversight bodies in a discussion and sharing of perspectives on  oversight issues of mutual concern in this collaborative setting. Among the issues  discussed  were  management  concerns  regarding  the  sheer  volume  of  recommendations as well as duplication of recommendations among oversight  bodies, and systemic risks and deficiencies encountered in the work of the oversight  bodies.   29. The dialogue has been well received by the oversight bodies as a ""significant  development"" in terms of their relationship with senior management and their  reporting responsibilities to the General Assembly. Expected outcomes from this  first series of dialogue meetings include an identification and assessment of  systemic risks and deficiencies faced by the Organization and a plan by management  to address them.   30. In support of this dialogue, the Department of Management intends to conduct  reviews of the systemic risks identified and of which risks might benefit from  systemic solutions. Systemic analyses will then provide the basis for more  comprehensive solutions to Secretariat-wide issues and weaknesses and will  broaden the scope of monitoring that is currently somewhat fragmented, as it is  derived from data gathered at the level of each individual Department.   31. To strengthen the oversight regime further, the General Assembly, in its  resolution 60/248, established the Independent Audit Advisory Committee as a  subsidiary body of the Assembly to serve in an advisory capacity and to assist the  Assembly in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. By resolution 61/275, the terms  of reference of the Committee were approved, including that the Committee will  advise the Assembly on measures to ensure the compliance of management with  audit and other oversight recommendations.    A/64/640   11  10-22371    32. In June 2008, the Chair of the Management Committee wrote to the Chair of  the Independent Audit Advisory Committee stating that the Management Committee  was the high-level mechanism established under my authority to effectively feed the  findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive  management processes. The Chair of the Management Committee also pledged the  support and cooperation of that Committee in supporting the work of the Audit  Advisory Committee in its important advisory role for the General Assembly. In  2010, the Management Committee intends to issue a quarterly communication to the  Chair of the Advisory Committee on progress in implementing oversight  recommendations.        Recommendations      I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  oversight bodies of the United Nations, as they play an important role in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring  mismanagement in the United Nations.    I also encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  Management Committee in feeding the findings and recommendations of  the oversight bodies into the executive management processes, in ensuring  the timely follow-up and implementation of those recommendations and in  strengthening the dialogue with the oversight bodies initiated in 2009.         D. Personal and institutional accountability      33. The critical linkage between institutional accountability and individual  accountability is established through the workplans contained in the annual  performance compacts for senior managers and the performance appraisal system6  for staff at all levels below that of the Assistant Secretary-General. Responsibility  for results consistent with the approved organizational goals and objectives will thus  cascade down through these workplans of successive levels of managers and staff.   34. These interlinked and cascading agreements between staff and managers  constitute the fundamental and essential building blocks for holding staff  accountable for the achievement of specific results. It is a basic tenet of  accountability that each manager or staff member must have relevant resources at  his or her disposal, and must have adequate authority and control over those  resources to achieve the mandated results. As stated in a previous report on  accountability, ""accountability will be in direct proportion to the responsibility  assigned and the authority delegated"" (A/C.5/49/1).  35. Member States may recall that I have strengthened the system of compacts  with senior managers over the past several years. In 2008, I extended the use of  these compacts to include the Assistant Secretary-General level. Subsequently, I  made the individual performance assessments available on the Secretariat Intranet to  increase transparency to a level that I believe is unprecedented among international  organizations. Starting in 2010 and following a recommendation by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services, I will sign compacts with my special representatives  __________________    6  The reform of performance appraisal mechanisms is discussed separately in section F of the  present report.  A/64/640      10-22371  12    and heads of mission in field operations led by the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Political  Affairs. The compacts will serve as a mechanism to measure their performance and  ensure a clear reporting line and accountability.   36. I believe it is critical to improve the integration of the objectives in the senior  managers' compacts with the overall objectives of the Organization. As  departmental performance should reflect that of the senior manager, I intend to  institute a mechanism to review the programme performance report and the senior  managers' compacts simultaneously by the Management Performance Board. To that  end, I have amended the terms of reference of that Board to include the review of  the programme performance report as one of its functions, in order to establish a  link between the performance of individual senior managers and that of her or his  department or office.   37. Furthermore, I have instructed the Department of Management to explore ways  and means to relate the findings and decisions of the new system of administration  of justice to the performance assessments of managers and staff at all levels. I also  hope to use that information to identify and address systemic managerial issues  affecting the performance of the entire Organization. The process will serve as a  mechanism to monitor the use of decision-making authority by staff at all levels,  and to reflect it in their performance appraisals and human resource action plans,  when appropriate. For example, if a pattern of wrongful or improper decisions taken  by the same manager is identified, I will take appropriate action to ensure that the  responsible staff member is held accountable.   38. In addition, in the context of the proposed global field support strategy (see  A/64/633), to be considered by the General Assembly later in 2010, consideration  will be given to measures aimed at developing a culture of greater empowerment,  accompanied by a more robust accountability framework for staff in the field with  management and administrative responsibilities.  39. The administrative instruction on the performance appraisal system and the  accompanying guidelines for using the system provide details of the individual  assessment process, as well as actions to be taken in cases of poor performance.  These actions range from developing a performance improvement plan to  termination for unsatisfactory service.   40. At present, individual staff members are recognized for satisfactory  performance by receiving a within-grade salary increment. However, there are very  few mechanisms for recognizing or rewarding high-performing individuals. After a  comprehensive review and broad consultations throughout the Secretariat earlier  this year, I have authorized a reoriented UN 21 awards programme that will  recognize outstanding initiatives by an individual or a team of individuals. The  revised programme will follow a two-tiered approach that consists of a centralized  and streamlined UN 21 awards programme and a decentralized recognition  programme that heads of departments and offices can institute within their area of  responsibility. Nominations for the 2010 UN 21 awards will be submitted in three  categories: (a) climate change/greening the United Nations; (b) improvements in  client services; and (c) inter-departmental initiatives. Special emphasis will be  placed on contributions that further the objectives of the United Nations, show  significant impact and innovation, and serve as good practices for the Organization.    A/64/640   13  10-22371    41. Institutional performance is monitored and reported to Member States through  the programme performance report (see sect. B). Other related issues, such as those  regarding the strategic framework and the linkage between performance and  resource allocation, are discussed in section H, on results-based management.        E. Selection and appointment of senior managers      42. Under General Assembly resolution 51/226, Member States have entrusted me  with the discretionary authority to appoint staff at the level of Under-Secretary- General and Assistant Secretary-General, as well as special envoys at all levels. I  have exercised this authority voluntarily with great care to ensure transparency and  maintain the institutional safeguards of the process, while protecting the privacy of  the applicants.   43. The main steps of the selection and appointment process are as follows:     (a)  Upcoming openings are reviewed on an ongoing basis in order to  commence the required selection process in a timely manner;     (b)  Predetermined criteria, against which the candidates are to be reviewed,  are established and reflected in the terms of reference of the interview panel and  conveyed to the Member States when soliciting nominations;     (c)  In order to ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates for such  positions, a notification is sent to Member States through a note verbale and an  advertisement is placed in suitable print media and United Nations websites, as  needed, to complement my own search efforts;     (d)  In keeping with my desire to have a rigorous selection process, the  consideration of the candidates includes review and advice by a panel of senior  United Nations officials with relevant knowledge and experience drawn from the  United Nations Secretariat and/or the funds and programmes, as well as outside  experts as deemed necessary;    (e)  At the conclusion of the process, the most suitable final candidates, of  which at least one is a woman, are submitted to me for final decision;     (f)  I personally interview the finalists, as appropriate, prior to making my  decision;     (g)  For some positions, consultation with intergovernmental bodies is  required and conducted accordingly.  44. This clear approach enhances objectivity by recommending to me an inclusive  and well-considered shortlist of senior personalities both inside and outside the  Organization. It also enhances transparency by bringing to the attention of the  Member States upcoming openings in a timely manner. It further aims to enable me  to select the most competent candidates with due regard for geographical  distribution and the gender representation of the Organization.         F. Reform of the performance appraisal system      45. The performance appraisal system is meant to link programmes mandated by  the General Assembly to departmental, divisional, sectional and, finally, individual  A/64/640      10-22371  14    workplans, constituting a fundamental accountability mechanism within the  Organization. The system establishes each individual's contribution to and  accountability for the achievement of agreed results. It allows individual goals to be  clarified at the beginning of the cycle in the workplan, keep performance on track  through ongoing dialogue, and evaluate performance at the end of the cycle.   46. The performance appraisal system currently used in the Organization suffers  from weaknesses that hamper its effectiveness including:    (a)  Inconsistency in the interpretation or application of the rating scales;    (b)  Insufficient linkage to learning, career development and succession  planning;    (c)  Knowledge gaps among staff and managers regarding the performance  management system;     (d)  Uneven compliance with the performance appraisal system by staff and  managers;     (e)  Technical difficulties in accessing the performance appraisal system  electronic tool remotely.  47. Pending a comprehensive revision of the performance management system, the  Department of Management is taking a number of short-term measures to strengthen  the performance appraisal mechanism. The Office of Human Resources  Management is spearheading the development of a new electronic performance  management tool as part of the talent management system, which is scheduled to be  launched on 1 April 2010.   48. The issue of performance management is also related to the culture of the  Organization, extending beyond the mere systems and tools available for assessing  staff performance. I intend to promote a cultural change within the Organization  whereby staff understand that they will be held accountable for the quality and  timely delivery of their work and supervisors understand they will be held  accountable for effectively managing their staff towards that end. Training will be  essential to effect this cultural change.  49. Mandatory training on performance management will be instituted for all staff  and managers, particularly those who supervise the work of others. Specific  performance management components, such as providing feedback, setting goals  and objectives, and addressing underperformance, are being reinforced in additional  learning sessions. I am confident that these measures will equip staff and managers  with the requisite skills to manage performance more effectively.   50. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/250, I will be submitting a  separate report to the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session on the reform of the  performance appraisal system. Benefiting from broad consultations among all  stakeholders that are currently still under way, the proposal will explore various  issues, such as a possible 180/360 degree feedback mechanism, a strategy for  mandatory performance training for managers and supervisors, strengthening the  role of the Management Review Committee and the Joint Monitoring Committee  (see ST/AI/2002/3) and creative ways to reward, recognize and motivate staff and  strengthen the remedies to address underperformance.         A/64/640   15  10-22371      G. Delegation of authority       51. Over the years my efforts to enhance accountability have been based on the  premise that giving managers more authority and responsibility for decision-making  is essential in order to improve the management of human and financial resources.  As Secretary-General, I have requested the Deputy Secretary-General to oversee  various administrative aspects of the Organization and to act on my behalf in this  regard. I have also delegated financial, human resources management and  procurement authority to heads of departments, offices, missions and tribunals  through the Under-Secretary-General for Management (see ST/AI/2004/1 and  ST/SGB/151). The granting of this latter authority is conveyed in a communication  that defines its scope, expectations regarding its discharge and the manner in which  it will be monitored. The Department of Management is responsible for monitoring  the exercise of authority in these areas and for assisting staff to carry out their  responsibilities properly. If deemed necessary, the level of authority can be reduced  or the authority withdrawn. The delegation of authority entails the exercise of  responsibility for ensuring full implementation of the relevant regulations and rules  of the United Nations and related administrative instructions, an example of which  is the delegation of financial authority, as laid out in administrative instruction  ST/AI/2004/1. This delegation of authority is personal and the individual to whom  authority is delegated is directly responsible to the Assistant Secretaries-General in  each of the functional areas, to the Under-Secretary-General for Management, and  ultimately to me.  52. The challenge of monitoring delegation of authority in various areas has grown  in tandem with the increase in Secretariat operations and field missions over the  years. The difficulties stem from inadequate management information systems that  do not backstop the delegation process in a user-friendly and efficient manner. This  has added cumbersome processes to the system of delegation of authority, and  serious efforts are under way to streamline the current arrangements and strengthen  accountability. I intend to clarify the responsibilities of all involved and streamline  the mechanisms for effective and efficient delegation of authority by drawing on  recommendations of the oversight bodies in this regard.7 These include a clear  vertical chain of command, effective policies to guide delegation of authority,  provision of efficient systems of support, a central repository of all delegations, and  continuous performance assessment.  53. In addition, I have instructed the Department of Management to lead an  interdepartmental effort, to review and update the other types of delegation of  authority existing in the Secretariat (substantive, institutional and by designation) to  specify clear responsibilities in these areas and to achieve more efficiency in the  implementation of these delegations of authority.        H. Implementation of the results-based management framework      54. The concept of results-based management was first introduced in the  Secretariat by the Joint Inspection Unit, which included as part of its definition of  results-based management not only the process of planning, programming,  __________________    7  Audit report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on management of delegation of  authority (AH2007/510/1) and Joint Inspection Unit report (JIU/REP/2004/7, see A/59/631).  A/64/640      10-22371  16    budgeting and evaluation, but also issues such as delegation of authority,  accountability, staff performance management and contracts. The Joint Inspection  Unit produced a series of reports on management for results8 that were presented to  the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session. The  conclusions and recommendations of the Committee at that session were endorsed  by the General Assembly in resolution 60/257. It should also be recalled that the  Assembly, in paragraph 3 of resolution 63/276, endorsed the conclusions and  recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions and that the Advisory Committee, in paragraph 38 of its report  (A/63/457), recommended to the Assembly that it should endorse my proposal (see  A/62/701 and Corr.1, para. 104 (b)) for a results-based management framework,  including its five principles, to foster a more results-oriented Secretariat by  integrating and strengthening the cycle of strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring  and evaluation.   55. The Joint Inspection Unit has defined results-based management as ""a  management approach focused on achieving results; a broad management strategy  aimed at the way agencies operate, with improving performance (achieving results)  as the central orientation"".9 As defined by the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (A/63/268, para. 1), results-based management is ""a management strategy by which  the Secretariat ensures that its processes, outputs and services contribute to the  achievement of clearly stated expected accomplishments and objectives. It focuses  on achieving results and improving performance, integrating lessons learned into  management decisions and monitoring of and reporting on performance"". From both  definitions, key concepts for the implementation of results-based management  emerge: formulating objectives and selecting indicators to measure progress towards  these objectives; collecting and analysing data on results to monitor performance;  and integrating evaluations and lessons learned for management decisions. The  General Assembly endorsed the principles of the results-based management  framework I have proposed to establish the practice of results-based management in  the Secretariat. This framework is based on the understanding that results-based  management is a broad management approach that uses information about results  for strategic planning, human resources and budgetary decision-making,  performance measurement and learning (A/62/701 and Corr.1, para. 65).   56. The foundation of results-based management consists of a system of cascading  elements that builds upon the ""assumption of a logical hierarchy or chain of cause- and-effect relationships from inputs through outputs to outcomes"" (A/63/268,   para. 3). To put it simply, in the Secretariat, this chain is broken in several places, a  fact that makes it impossible to advance the results-based management framework  in a coherent and holistic manner and, at the same time, adversely affects the  accountability framework of the Secretariat.   57. There are four critical links in the results-based management framework that  are weak and must be addressed in order to advance implementation of results-based  management in the Secretariat.  58. A first critical link is contained in part one of the strategic framework  document, which defines the objectives of the Organization. During the biennium  __________________    8  JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7 and JIU/REP/2004/8, see A/59/617,  A/59/607, A/59/631 and A/59/632.    9  JIU/REP/2004/6, box 1; see A/59/607.    A/64/640   17  10-22371    2006-2007, Member States decided to take no decision on this part and to request  me to prepare and propose a plan outline reflecting the longer-term objectives of the  Organization based on a set of priorities defined by them and taking into  consideration the outcomes of the intergovernmental conferences and summits,  inputs from relevant programme managers, and the use of intergovernmentally  agreed terms and expressions. They approved only part two of the strategic  framework document, the biennial programme plan. A similar situation occurred  during the biennium 2008-2009. Thus, the programme budget had to be developed  in the absence of clearly stated mandated objectives that, under the covenant  between Member States and the Secretariat, the Secretariat should have received.  For the biennium 2010-2011, the Committee for Programme and Coordination, at its  forty-eighth session, recommended that the General Assembly should further review  the plan outline (part one) of the proposed framework for the period 2010-2011, so  that it more accurately reflected the longer-term objectives of the Organization  based on all mandates that had been approved by the Member States. The  Committee also requested me to present future plan outlines (part one) of proposed  strategic frameworks taking fully into account the guidelines provided by the  General Assembly in its resolutions 59/275, 61/235 and 62/224, as well as  subsequent relevant resolutions, so as to ensure that they more accurately captured  the longer-term objectives of the Organization, based on all mandates that had been  approved by the Member States. In resolution 63/247, the Assembly endorsed the  conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for Programme and  Coordination on the proposed biennial programme plan for the period 2010-2011  and approved the priorities for the period 2010-2011 contained in the plan outline. I  request Member States to continue the trend of forging a consensus that allows for  the adoption of the complete strategic framework document for future budget  cycles.   59. A second critical link relates to the logical frameworks for each  subprogramme. These are found in part two of the strategic framework document,  the biennial programme plan, and are also reflected in the programme budget.  Shortcomings of the results-based budgeting logical frameworks include the  following:    (a)  Broad objectives and priorities set at the top of the Organization are not  always linked to those at the lower levels and are sometimes not clearly formulated  or attainable;     (b)  Some  expected  accomplishments  and  associated  indicators  of  achievement are formulated at the level of activities and outputs and do not  necessarily lend themselves to the achievement of established objectives;     (c)  Some performance measures are not appropriately related to their  corresponding indicators of achievement;     (d)  External factors are not based on an appropriate risk assessment.10  __________________    10  Some of these weaknesses have been described in previous reports of the oversight bodies, such  as the Office of Internal Oversight Services review of results-based management at the United Nations,  which concluded that ""Results-based management at the United Nations has been an administrative  chore of little value to accountability and decision-making"" (A/63/268); the Joint Inspection Unit  evaluation of results-based budgeting in peacekeeping operations (JIU/REP/2006/1, see A/60/709); and  the series of Joint Inspection Unit reports referred to above in footnote 4.  A/64/640      10-22371  18    60. The current formulation of the logical frameworks limits the implementation  of an effective accountability system in the Secretariat in several ways:     (a)  The nature of the work of the Secretariat is such that multiple actors and  exogenous factors critically affect the achievement of many outcomes and results.  Greater effort should be made to accurately capture and reflect the unique and  specific contribution of the Secretariat to the achievement of outcomes. While this  problem is inherent in any results-based management methodology, this limitation  could be reduced with well-formulated logical frameworks;    (b)  Results and outcomes are not logically linked with activities and outputs  in performance reporting. This limits the possibility of forging a vision of the  intended effects of the contributions of the activities and outputs at the level of  objectives and expected accomplishments, and of reporting meaningfully on their  actual achievement;     (c)  Indicators of achievement are sometimes not a good reflection of whether  or the extent to which the objectives have been achieved.  61. A third critical link for an effective results-based management framework and  accountability, which has been raised by the oversight bodies in some of the reports  referenced elsewhere in the present report, is the connection between results and  resource allocation. As resources are allocated at the subprogramme level, an effort  will be made in the context of the implementation of Umoja to improve the  relationship between programmatic and financial aspects of programmes and  subprogrammes and the further breakdown of resources to the level of expected  results (see also para. 69 below).  62. A fourth critical link is the ability of the Secretariat to implement self- evaluations and to actively include lessons learned in the programme and planning  process of the Organization. With the introduction of results-based budgeting in the  Secretariat, self-evaluation tools were expected to become a strong instrument to  determine the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact of programme  delivery.11 In addition to the independent evaluations conducted by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services and the Joint Inspection Unit, in General Assembly  resolution 63/247 Member States called on programme managers to fulfil their  responsibilities with respect to self-evaluation and sought more detailed information  on the outcome of monitoring and evaluation at the departmental and executive  levels, taking into account, in particular, how lessons learned were shared and  applied in planning activities. To date, the capacities dedicated to this important task  are still very limited and additional resources have not been forthcoming. An  evaluation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services on learning lessons  (E/AC.51/2009/5) found that the Secretariat was weak overall in this area and  identified several obstacles to learning lessons effectively. I am encouraged,  however, by the fact that the Assembly has reaffirmed the importance of  strengthening evaluation in the United Nations system (see resolution 63/311) and  requested me to submit, at the sixty-fourth session, a proposal with modalities for  the establishment of an independent, system-wide evaluation mechanism to assess  system-wide efficiency, effectiveness and performance, bearing in mind the  __________________    11  The Joint Inspection Unit noted that ""self-evaluation should constitute the backbone of any  effective evaluation system in order to provide timely analysis of the performance of  projects and programmes"". (JIU/REP/2004/6, para. 68; see A/59/607).    A/64/640   19  10-22371    evaluation functions carried out by respective United Nations organizations, the  Joint Inspection Unit and the United Nations Evaluation Group. I intend to use the  internal discussions that will be generated by the present report to address the issue  of self-evaluation and to propose comprehensive measures to address the  weaknesses of the self-evaluation systems in some areas of the Secretariat guided,  inter alia, by the important advances that have been achieved in this by the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations.12   63. It is my firm belief that substantive progress on the implementation of results- based management in the Secretariat will depend largely on the strength of the four  critical links in the results-based management chain of cause-and-effect  relationships that I have outlined above. I would urge Member States to explore  ways and means to address these issues in a comprehensive manner.   64. With the substantive support and guidance of the Department of Management,  departments and offices throughout the Secretariat are making concerted efforts to  strengthen the quality of their respective results-based management documents. To  further advance this process, a dedicated capacity is needed that can foster a  common understanding of the principles of results-based management and promote  a culture of results. In its resolution 64/243, the General Assembly stressed that  ""improved implementation of results-based budgeting enhances both management  and accountability in the Secretariat"", and encouraged me to continue my efforts in  this regard and requested me to further improve the results-based budgeting  framework. In addition, the Assembly stressed ""the importance of adequate training  to ensure the full implementation of results-based budgeting"". In the light of the  views expressed by Member States and relevant oversight bodies about the  continuing absence of a fully mature results-based management culture, it is my  view that an ad hoc, uncoordinated and inconsistent approach to results-based  management within the Organization and all its varied activities can no longer be  sustained if we are to be a fully results-oriented Organization. The absence of a  dedicated capacity all these years has slowed the process of changing the  management culture. Therefore, I propose to establish a Results Management Unit  in the Department of Management to provide assistance and support to managers  throughout the Secretariat. The Unit would be tasked to:    (a)  Manage, oversee and support the implementation of the results-based  management system within the United Nations, including for peacekeeping  operations and special political missions;    (b)  Support  the  preparation  of  logical  frameworks  in  Secretariat  programmes, including peacekeeping operations and special political missions, to  ensure adequate focus on expected results and effective linkages between objectives,  expected accomplishments and indicators;  __________________    12  The Department of Peacekeeping Operations has created an Evaluation Unit, located within  the Policy, Evaluation and Training Division, which provides services to the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and field missions. This Unit  implements programme evaluations of missions, cross-cutting evaluations of selected  components across missions and impromptu evaluations. The main findings of these  evaluations are incorporated into the policy development, best practices and training  activities that contribute to the institutional strengthening of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.  A/64/640      10-22371  20      (c)  Review the monitoring component of the planning cycle, including the  format and content of the programme performance report;    (d)  Coordinate and report on ongoing internal programme performance  monitoring;    (e)  Support and guide the performance by Secretariat programmes of self- evaluations and utilization of lessons learned;    (f)  Update and strengthen results-based management procedures and  guidelines (standards and methodology);     (g)  Develop and maintain an indicator bank;     (h)  Review and modify the formulation and standardization of outputs;     (i)  Support a network of results-based management/results-based budgeting  practitioners across the Secretariat and develop a regular and ongoing exchange of  information materials;     (j)  Provide training and guidance on the results-based management concept,  preparation of the strategic frameworks and budget logical frameworks, programme  performance monitoring, self-evaluation and utilization of lessons learned;     (k)  Review, update and modify the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8), as appropriate;     (l)  Ensure linkages among the programme planning, budgeting, monitoring  and evaluation mechanisms and instruments of the Secretariat, including for  peacekeeping operations and special political missions, for the effective  implementation of results-based management within the Organization;     (m) Maintain and upgrade the Integrated Monitoring and Documentation  Information System (IMDIS).  65. I will also ensure that the review of the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, included as one of the  responsibilities of the Results Management Unit, is comprehensive and conducted  with a view towards enabling the full implementation of results-based management  and aimed at enhancing both management and accountability in the Secretariat.        Recommendation      I propose the establishment of a Results Management Unit in the Office of  Programme Planning, Budgets and Accounts of the Department of  Management as detailed in paragraphs 64 and 65 above to provide  support for the effective implementation of the results-based management  methodology throughout the Secretariat. The associated resource  requirements for the Results Management Unit would be presented in due  course as appropriate.        A/64/640   21  10-22371      I. Results-based management information system       66. One of the key features of an effective results-based budgeting system is the  ability to establish a link among objectives, results and resources. I regret to note  that the main information systems currently used in the planning, programming,  monitoring and evaluation cycle of the Organization (IMDIS and the Integrated  Management Information System (IMIS)) do not have such a linkage.   67. IMDIS is an Internet-based system used in the preparation of both the strategic  framework and the programme budget to capture information on programmatic  content. It is also used in monitoring work programme implementation, organizing  and storing data on performance and the preparation of the programme performance  report. IMDIS was not originally intended for this purpose, as it was developed by  the Department for Economic and Social Affairs with a much more limited scope,  namely to assist senior managers in tracking the implementation of programme  outputs and meeting performance reporting requirements of the General Assembly.   68. IMIS is the principal electronic system for the management of human and  financial resources in the United Nations Secretariat. It supports personnel, finance,  payroll, procurement, travel and related administrative functions and is at the core  of many administrative workflows. IMIS does not include information on  programmes and has no link to IMDIS. This fundamental gap in the Organization's  information management system explains why the Secretariat is left grappling for  answers when Member States inquire about the cost entailed in meeting a given  programmatic objective.   69. We need to remedy this situation by introducing a reliable information  management system to support results-based budgeting, and eventually results- based management. Such a system must align resources with objectives and results.  An effective management system that links resources to objectives would also allow  assessment of the performance level of a programme relative to the resources  provided to it. It would facilitate measurement of the effect that resource allocation  changes have on programme performance.   70. In the context of Umoja, I have proposed an integrated management system  that will provide an efficient means for transferring and sharing information across  the many different functions of the Organization. As I stated when I made the  business case for Umoja (see A/64/380), I expect improved transparency and timely  reporting to Member States and senior management on expenditure, commitments  and results to be among the major qualitative benefits of such a single information  repository.         Recommendation      I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja project, which will link resources to objectives and will also allow  assessment of the performance level of a programme relative to the  resources provided to it.      A/64/640      10-22371  22      J. Enterprise risk management and internal control framework      71. The United Nations faces an increasing level of risk owing to the complexities  of its operations and increased scope of its mandates. Risk management is already  considered at various levels in the United Nations and is embedded in different  processes and operations. Departments and programmes have developed their own  methodologies, however, by adopting one of several different risk management  standards currently available. As a result, the processes currently in place do not  share a consistent methodology for identifying, evaluating, reporting and responding  to risks.   72. Promoting a systematic risk-based approach to management decisions and risk  mitigation is more critical than ever. I believe that the time has come to strengthen  the current approach of the Organization by adopting an integrated enterprise risk  management and internal control framework that will provide a consistent and  comprehensive risk management methodology for the entire Secretariat. Pursuant to  General Assembly resolution 63/276, a road map and implementation plan for the  establishment of such a framework is outlined in annex II. The implementation plan  is expected to be completed in approximately two years.  73. I foresee that this framework would provide the Organization with a more  effective means of addressing both the strategic risks associated with the execution  of the mandates defined in the Charter of the United Nations and the operational  risks that support the achievement of those mandates. Once implemented, the  framework will significantly enhance the governance and management practices of  the Secretariat. It will strengthen the focus on objectives and will increase our  effectiveness to achieve the defined objectives and the mandates given by Member  States.  74. Enterprise risk management is the inherent core responsibility of management.  Under the proposed framework, embedded risk and internal control management  activities will become an integral part of the processes and operations of the entire  Organization. Accountability and performance management will be enhanced  through the definition of clear risk-management roles and responsibilities. The  promotion of a risk-driven culture will be strengthened through a more informed  risk-based decision-making capability. Transparency will be improved within the  Organization and towards Member States, as risks are clearly communicated  internally and externally through formal reporting by management to relevant  stakeholders.   75. The recognition of the responsibility of management for internal controls and  the appropriate management of risk will improve the effectiveness of the controls.  Furthermore, governance and oversight functions will be enhanced as senior  managers and governing bodies will have an increased capability to make informed  decisions regarding risk and reward trade-offs related to existing and new  programmes.  76. According to best practices in both private and public sector global  organizations that have adopted enterprise-wide risk-management frameworks, an  independent enterprise risk management function should be established under the  direction of a Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the head of the  Organization. According to this vision, a new independent and objective  organizational team should be created to facilitate effective risk-management    A/64/640   23  10-22371    practices. I encourage Member States to keep such a structure under consideration  for the medium term.   77. For the short term, the overall implementation of an effective enterprise risk  management and internal control framework throughout the United Nations  Secretariat would be led by a dedicated enterprise risk management and internal  control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section, that I  propose to be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management. I wish to emphasize that management will be the owner of risk  management and control activities in the Secretariat. To support management, the  Section would:    (a)  Provide assistance to Secretariat entities implementing risk management  and control procedures;     (b)  Aggregate risk data from the different unit locations;     (c)  Carry out regular monitoring of United Nations Secretariat-wide risks;     (d)  Advance the adoption of consistent methodologies for risk assessment;     (e)  Facilitate the implementation of enhanced control and risk mitigation  measures at the department, office, commission, mission and tribunal levels in  cooperation with dedicated local risk and control focal points.   78. I am convinced that the risk profile of the Organization and the effectiveness  of the designed controls should inform strategic planning and managerial decision- making. Once established and firmly rooted in the Secretariat, an effective  enterprise risk management and control process will become instrumental to  promote a risk-aware culture. It is my profound hope that Member States will use  the risk management information that will become available under the proposed  framework in their strategic planning and resource allocation decision-making.         Recommendations      I recommend that an enterprise risk management and internal control  framework be established in the United Nations Secretariat in accordance  with the proposed road map, with a view to fully integrating the  framework with major managerial processes, such as strategic and  operational planning, operational and financial management and  performance measurement and management.     To that end, I further recommend that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management. The associated resource requirements for the  Section would be presented in due course as appropriate.      A/64/640      10-22371  24      K. How the current and proposed accountability mechanisms in the  Secretariat would have addressed the flaws in the management of  the United Nations oil-for-food programme13      79. Although some of the deficiencies in the oil-for-food programme were outside  the control of the United Nations Secretariat, the Independent Inquiry Committee  identified several weaknesses in the administration of the programme, which, if  addressed, could improve the way the Organization conducts business.14 The  present report addresses those weaknesses identified by the Independent Inquiry  Committee that are within the purview of the Secretariat, including inadequate  internal audit coverage, poor implementation of audit recommendations, absence of  an independent audit committee, conflicts of interest, weakened internal control,  inadequate monitoring of programme implementation by agencies, non-conformity  with procurement rules, and narrowly defined external audit scope.   80. I am pleased to report that in recent years, since the Independent Inquiry  Committee reports were issued, many changes have been made to the accountability  system of the United Nations Secretariat that significantly strengthen the  accountability of the Organization and would likely address or even prevent the kind  of flaws found in the oil-for-food programme. These changes include:    (a)  Oversight. The Management Committee was established. Chaired by the  Deputy Secretary-General, its major functions include (i) a quarterly review of the  status of implementation of various accepted recommendations of the oversight  bodies; and (ii) the responsibility to ensure that recommendations of oversight  bodies are effectively fed into the executive management process;    (b)  Internal/external audit. The Independent Audit Advisory Committee  was established with clear reporting obligations (General Assembly resolution  60/248) and terms of reference (resolution 61/275) that include, inter alia, review of  Office of Internal Oversight Services budgets based on a risk-based approach to the  management of oversight functions and provision of advice to the Assembly on risk  management procedures and on possible deficiencies in the internal control  framework of the United Nations. While recognizing the urgent need to substantially  strengthen the oversight and management process, the Assembly, in its resolution  60/1, decided that the expertise, capacity and resources of the Office of Internal  Oversight Services in respect of audit and investigations should be significantly  strengthened and this has been addressed;    (c)  Administration of the programme. The Ethics Office was established  and has developed policies related to potential conflicts of interest, financial  disclosure and whistle blower protection (see ST/SGB/2006/6 and ST/SGB/  2005/21);    (d)  Monitoring programme implementation. This weakness could be  addressed by a robust results-based management framework such as the one I  describe in section H above;  __________________    13  A more detailed assessment, prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/276,  para. 9 (k), is contained in annex III.    14  See Independent Inquiry Committee, interim report, dated 3 February 2005, second interim  report, dated 29 March 2005, third interim report, dated 8 August 2005, and report on the  management of the oil-for-food programme, dated 7 September 2005 (vols. II, III and IV).    A/64/640   25  10-22371      (e)  Procurement process. Within the context of the procurement reform  efforts of the Secretariat, I introduced measures for strengthened internal control  and the promotion of ethics, integrity, fairness and transparency in the procurement  process, including the establishment of an independent mechanism to review  challenges to procurement awards.  81. Furthermore, the enterprise risk management framework proposed in the  present report would help to identify high-risk areas and develop requisite  mitigation strategies.        III. Conclusions      82. Earlier in the present report, I stated that accountability in the United Nations  originates from a covenant between Member States and the Secretariat, as expressed  in the strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping budgets.  Member States provide the mandates for what the United Nations must achieve in a  given cycle with the resources appropriated. The Secretariat is obliged to deliver the  results established thereby, subject to the availability of resources and constraints  posed by external factors beyond its control.   83. To bring this covenant to life, all stakeholders must do their part. Member  States must provide clear and concise mandates and relevant resources and  recognize the authority of the Secretariat to facilitate mandate implementation. In  turn, it is incumbent upon me, as Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization,  to be responsive to the directives given by Member States and lead the Secretariat in  the implementation of the mandates entrusted to us. The instruments that ensure that  the Organization operates in an accountable manner must continue to mature and  evolve.  84. The Charter of the United Nations sets noble objectives for the Organization.  We must strive for excellence and be fully accountable for our actions as we take  responsibility for these objectives and work towards their implementation. We owe  nothing less to the peoples of the United Nations.        IV. Recommendations      85. To enable more performance-informed decision-making by Member States  regarding programme plans and budgets, I produced as a pilot an interim  programme performance report covering the first year of the biennium 2008- 2009. I propose to supplement the comprehensive biennial programme  performance report with an interim report on the progress made by the  Secretariat towards achievement of expected results at the end of the first year  of each biennium.   86. I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja (enterprise resource planning) project, which incorporates, inter alia,  the development of interoperable information management tools needed to  effectively support results-based budgeting and eventually results-based  management, linking resources to objectives and allowing assessment of  programme performance relative to resources.   A/64/640      10-22371  26    87.  I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  oversight bodies of the United Nations, as they play an important role in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring  mismanagement in the United Nations.   88. I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  Management Committee in feeding the findings and recommendations of the  oversight bodies into executive management processes, in ensuring the timely  follow-up and implementation of those recommendations and in strengthening  the dialogue with the oversight bodies initiated in 2009.   89. I propose the establishment of a Results Management Unit in the Office of  Programme Planning, Budgets and Accounts of the Department of  Management as detailed in paragraphs 64 and 65 above to provide support for  the effective implementation of the results-based management methodology  throughout the Secretariat. The associated resource requirements for the  Results Management Unit would be presented in due course as appropriate.  90. I recommend that an enterprise risk management and internal control  framework be established in the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with  the proposed road map with a view to fully integrating the framework with  major managerial processes, such as strategic and operational planning,  operational and financial management and performance measurement and  management.   91. To that end, I further recommend that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General  for Management. The associated resource requirements for the Section would  be presented in due course as appropriate.  92. I propose that Member States endorse the components of an  Accountability System for the Secretariat as described in the present report  and the measures for increased accountability described therein.     A/64/640   27  10-22371    Annex I       Components of the accountability system in the   United Nations Secretariat        I. Introduction      1.  The present annex explains the fundamental elements of the United Nations  accountability system, which is composed of six interrelated components:    (a)  Accountability devolved from the Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  The covenant with Member States: the strategic framework, the  programme budget and peacekeeping budgets;    (c)  Delivering results and performance (including a system of rewards and  sanctions);    (d)  Internal systems and controls;    (e)  Ethical standards and integrity;    (f)  Oversight roles and functions.   2.  For each of the six components, where applicable, this annex provides an  overview of the regulations, systems and structures that are in place to ensure the  proper functioning of the Organization. Its purpose is to provide Member States  with the tools that will allow them to effectively oversee and hold the Organization  accountable for the delivery of mandated objectives and results and to serve as a  guide for managers and staff at all levels to enable them to clearly understand the  present elements of the accountability system in the Secretariat.        II. Accountability devolved from the Charter of the   United Nations      3.  The Charter of the United Nations forms the basis of the accountability system  of the Organization. It puts Member States at the centre of the Organization, making  them responsible for giving mandates to the Secretariat through the resolutions and  decisions emanating from their representative organs. The Charter establishes the  Secretary-General as the Chief Administrative Officer of the United Nations (Article  97). The mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United Nations are  entrusted to him for their implementation (Article 98).  4.  Under this arrangement, an organizational structure emerges with the  following distribution of roles and duties: Member States are responsible for  providing mandates, expressed as directives, priorities and targets, and the  Secretary-General is responsible for implementing these mandates and for reporting  on outcomes and the resources used.  5.  In discharging these responsibilities, the Secretary-General is obliged to reflect  these mandates in the programme and planning documents of the Organization (the  strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping budgets) and  programme managers and individual staff members -- down the chain of  A/64/640      10-22371  28    responsibility -- are obliged to prepare their respective workplans with the purpose  of achieving the results established therein. During this process, the Secretariat must  continuously monitor performance, adjust implementation where needed, conduct  ongoing evaluations and use evaluation findings for improvement and learning. This  is an enriching process that is designed to achieve the best results for the benefit of  all stakeholders as is illustrated in the flow chart below.        Figure  Programme and planning cycle                                                                                                  6.  At the core of the accountability system in the Secretariat is the covenant or  agreement with Member States expressed in the form of the strategic framework, the  programme budget and peacekeeping budgets, as these documents clearly specify  what results the United Nations must achieve in a given cycle with the resources  appropriated to the Organization by Member States.        III. The covenant with Member States: the strategic framework,  the programme budget and peacekeeping budgets      7.  The strategic framework, the programme budget and peacekeeping budgets  constitute core components of the United Nations Secretariat's accountability  system. These documents of the Secretariat constitute a covenant with Member  States whereby the Secretariat commits, subject to the availability of resources and  barring exogenous impacts, to achieving certain results that have been mandated by  Member States.

A. Strategic framework      8.  Between 1974 and 2006, the medium-term plan was the principal planning  document of the United Nations. The policy orientation and goals established in the  legislative mandates of the intergovernmental organs were translated by the  medium-term plan into programmes and subprogrammes. The medium-term plan  developed for the 1998-2001 period moved towards a results-based approach, as it  focused more on objectives than on activities and outputs, and sought to make a  clearer link between programmes and budget sections by aligning programmes to  major organizational units.  9.  The medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 was the first to reflect the  application of a logical framework, which provided the structure for biennial  programme  budgets.  The  2002-2005  plan  defined  objectives,  expected  accomplishments and indicators of achievement. In its formulation, programme  managers focused on the raison d'etre of their programmes and not just on  deliverables.  10. In 2002, the Secretary-General submitted his report entitled ""Strengthening of  the United Nations: an agenda for further change"" (A/57/387 and Corr.1), in which  he identified a number of weaknesses in the budgeting and planning process. These  weaknesses were addressed in the subsequent report, ""Strengthening of the United  Nations: an agenda for further change -- improvements to the current process of  planning and budgeting"" (A/58/395 and Corr.1). That report proposed a revision of  the medium-term plan, to be renamed ""Part one, biennial programme plan"" and  ""Part two, budget outline"", which would constitute a ""strategic framework"" for the  Organization and cover a two-year period. This proposal was endorsed by the  General Assembly in its resolution 58/269.  11. Following a trial period, the General Assembly decided, by its resolution  62/224, to maintain the strategic framework as the principal policy directive of the  United Nations with effect from the biennium 2010-2011 and to improve the format  of part one of the framework by elaborating on the priorities of the United Nations  in accordance with resolutions 61/235 and 59/275.  12. The strategic framework has now become the basis for programme planning,  budgeting, monitoring and evaluation in the Organization.a Part one is developed  centrally and highlights future challenges of the Organization, an overarching  perspective of world events that require action from the international community,  longer-term objectives to be met collectively by the Organization and Member  States, and the proposals of the Secretary-General on priorities. Part two delineates  the objectives, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement, strategy and  mandates for each subprogramme.      __________________    a  For peacekeeping missions, the basis is formed by the peacekeeping programme budgets.  A/64/640      10-22371  30      B. Programme budget      13. From 1945 to 1974, the United Nations budget was organized by object of  expenditure. The expenditure budgeting methodology had several limitations,  including the difficulty of specifying the cost of programmes and the difficulty for  Member States of knowing what the programmes comprised. Member States  demanded improvements and, as a result, a new programme budgeting methodology  was introduced in the biennium 1974-1975, which used a programmatic rather than  input-output approach. In 1993, the programme budget was modified to place more  focus on the relationships between mandates, programmes and budget sections of  the Secretariat, thus bringing increased accountability to the process.  14. In 1997, the Secretary-General submitted a report entitled ""Renewing the  United Nations: a programme for reform"" (A/51/950 and Corr.1 and Add.1-7), in  which he proposed, inter alia, that Member States should enter into a dialogue with  the aim of shifting the United Nations programme budget from a system of input  accounting to a results-based approach. Under this new system, the General  Assembly would specify the results they expected from the Organization, consistent  with relevant budgetary constraints, and the Secretariat would be responsible for,  and judged by, the extent to which these results were reached. Subsequently, the  Secretary-General submitted a report on results-based budgeting (A/54/456), in  which he sought the endorsement of the General Assembly for a gradual approach to  the introduction of results-based elements in the programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and evaluation cycle.  15. In its resolution 55/231, the General Assembly endorsed the implementation of  results-based budgeting in the United Nations, emphasizing the need to reflect  mandates, policy objectives, orientation and priorities of the Organization in  programme objectives. Expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement  were to be directly and clearly linked to the objectives of the Organization,  following the logical framework model.  16. In addition, in its resolution 55/231, the General Assembly supported, as a  matter of priority, development of information technology and cost accounting  systems that would meet the requirements of the results-based budgeting  methodology and also essential training programmes for staff to effectively  implement a results-based budgeting system. However, the Organization's capacity  to fully implement results-based budgeting has been limited.      1.  From results-based budgeting to results-based management    17. The concept of results-based management was first introduced to the United  Nations by the Joint Inspection Unit, which included as part of its definition of  results-based management not only the process of planning, programming,  budgeting and evaluation, but also delegation of authority, accountability, staff  performance management and contracts. The Joint Inspection Unit produced a series  of reports on management for resultsb that were presented to the Committee for  Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session. In addition, the Secretary- General conducted a study of results-based management, which resulted in proposed  __________________    b  JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7 and JIU/REP/2004/8; see A/59/617,  A/59/607, A/59/631 and A/59/632.    A/64/640   31  10-22371    actions for improvement, such as a peer review of the strategic framework and  logical frameworks to ensure improved ownership and better use of the information  on results for management and decision-making (A/62/701 and Corr.1). In that  context, while results-based budgeting had not yet been fully internalized in the  Secretariat and in the absence of a comprehensive set of rules and regulations that  were completely consistent with the results-based budgeting methodology,  implementation of a comprehensive results-based management system represented a  significant challenge.  18. Nevertheless, the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for  Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session were endorsed by the General  Assembly in its resolution 60/257, including the benchmarking framework proposed  by the Joint Inspection Unit as a tool for the Secretary-General and the oversight  bodies to measure progress towards the implementation of results-based  management in the United Nations. Thus, in 2006 results-based management  became a mandate to be implemented by the United Nations Secretariat. In 2009,  the Assembly again affirmed, United Nations resolution 63/276 its intention to see  results-based management implemented within the Secretariat.  19. The specific actions for results-based management implementation include  periodic reviews of the logical frameworks of the strategic framework and the  programme budget to ensure improved linkages between objectives, expected  accomplishments and indicators, as well as ownership and better use of the  information on results by the intergovernmental bodies and senior management.  While the key policies and standards on which to build a more results-oriented  Secretariat already exist, the availability of support, consistent guidance and  procedures, tools and training needs to be increased.        IV. Delivering results and performance      20. The third component of the accountability system entails the obligation to  actually deliver on the results established in the planning documents, subject to  constraints imposed by resource limitations and by the risk elements that are outside  the control of the Organization. Thus, the Secretariat is obliged to pursue agreed  objectives and deliver results, in compliance with established regulations, rules,  policies and procedures.        A. Institutional performance        1.  Programme performance report     21. The Secretariatc reports its performance in the context of the established  objectives of programme budgets to the General Assembly at the end of every  biennium in the form of a programme performance report. The content and  frequency of the programme performance report is governed by the Regulations and  Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  __________________    c  Peacekeeping missions report separately on their performance and on an annual basis, using the  same guidelines as established in the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning,  the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of  Evaluation.

The programme performance report contains an assessment of progress towards  objectives and expected accomplishments by each programme, as well as  explanations for lack of progress where applicable.  22. Programme managers are accountable for the achievement of objectives and  results and the delivery of outputs. They are also responsible for fairly and  accurately  reporting  on  these  matters.  The  Secretariat  monitors  these  accomplishments and reports to Member States on results achieved through the  Committee for Programme and Coordination. The Office of Internal Oversight  Services conducts ad hoc detailed audits of output delivery and results achieved as  reported by each programme manager.      2.  Self-evaluation and lessons learned    23. The introduction of results-based budgeting in the Secretariat called for the  development of a comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes,  including peacekeeping missions, and the improvement of monitoring and  evaluation activities. Self-evaluation has become an instrument for monitoring the  relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact of programme delivery and, starting  with the biennium 2006-2007, programme managers were required to include in  their budget proposals adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme  performance (see A/60/312).  24. In its resolution 60/254, the General Assembly stressed the importance of  programme managers conducting objective evaluations of programme performance  and of the Office of Internal Oversight Services validating managers' reports on  programme performance. Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions (see A/61/605) concluded, inter alia, that there was merit  in strengthening the capacity for evaluation at the level of programme management  (i.e., self-evaluation). However, to date the capacities dedicated to this important  task are still very limited and the additional resources needed to strengthen  evaluation functions have not been forthcoming.  25. This is, however, not the case in the area of peacekeeping operations, where, in  response to recommendations made by the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (see A/58/746 and A/61/743) and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' own  assessment, an Evaluation Unit was formed within the Policy, Evaluation and  Training Division of the Department. This Unit provides services to the Department  of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and field missions and  implements programme evaluations of missions, cross-cutting evaluations of  selected components across missions and impromptu evaluations. The main findings  of these evaluations are incorporated into the policy development, best practices and  training activities that contribute to the institutional strengthening of the Department  of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.        B. Individual performance      26. The critical linkage between institutional accountability and individual  accountability is established through annual performance compacts for senior  managers and performance appraisal documents for staff at all levels below that of  Assistant Secretary-General. The essence of the system is that workplans consistent    A/64/640   33  10-22371    with the approved organizational objectives and results cascade down through the  successive levels of managers and staff.  27. These interlinked and cascading agreements between staff and managers  constitute the fundamental and essential building blocks for holding the  Organization and staff accountable for the achievement of mandated results. It is a  basic tenet of accountability that each manager or staff member must have authority  and control over the resources required to achieve the expected results. Without  such authority and control there can be no true responsibility or accountability.       1.  Compacts with senior officials    28. Performance compacts constitute annual contracts between the Secretary- General and his most senior officials. They integrate into one document the  objectives, expected results and associated performance measures that are specific  to each department under the strategic framework and programme budget. In  addition, the Secretary-General has asked managers to incorporate into their  compacts various managerial targets, such as those related to implementation of the  recommendations of oversight bodies and matters related to financial management.   29. Since 2006, the Secretary-General has signed annual performance compacts  with his most senior officials (those serving at the level of Under-Secretary- General). In 2008, these compacts were extended to senior officials at the Assistant  Secretary-General level, who sign them with their respective Under-Secretaries- General.  30. At the end of each assessment cycle, the Management Performance Board  assesses each senior manager's performance against the targets set in the compact  and the human resources action plan and advises the Secretary-General of its  findings. Based on these findings, the Secretary-General requests senior managers to  submit a detailed action plan to the Board to address weaknesses identified in the  performance assessments. The Department of Field Support is currently engaged in  a review of the implementation of human resources action plans in field operations  to ensure greater accountability by the leadership.  31. The compacts are kept on record in the official status files of senior managers.  An assessment identifying areas of inadequate performance could trigger an  administrative action by the Secretary-General against a senior manager. In addition,  the compacts, as well as the individual performance assessments, are published on  the Secretariat Intranet, adding an increased level of transparency to the Secretariat  that, to the knowledge of the Secretariat, is unprecedented among international  organizations.  32. Senior managers are encouraged to share their compacts with their employees  to ensure that staff at all levels align their annual workplans with managerial  compacts. In so doing, senior managers ensure that achievement of agreed  organizational results cascades down to and is subsequently included in the  workplans of individual staff members.      2.  Performance appraisal system    33. In December 1993, in its resolution 48/218 A, the General Assembly endorsed  the recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination on the  ""establishment of a transparent and effective system of accountability and  A/64/640      10-22371  34    responsibility"" and further specified that such a system should include performance  evaluation for all officials. In response, the Secretariat implemented the  performance appraisal system in April 1996 and introduced an electronic version  that became mandatory on 1 April 2003.  34. The electronic performance appraisal system (e-PAS) is meant to link  programmes mandated by the General Assembly to departmental, divisional,  sectional  and,  finally,  individual  workplans,  constituting  a  fundamental  accountability mechanism within the Organization. The system establishes each  individual's contribution to and accountability for the achievement of agreed results.  The performance appraisal process enables managers to clarify individual goals at  the beginning of the cycle in the workplan, keep performance on track through  ongoing dialogue, and evaluate performance at the end of the cycle.  35. Accountability and individual responsibility consistent with actual authority  over relevant resources are encouraged throughout the process. A wide range of  creative learning and organizational development programmes has been designed to  systematically and progressively build management and leadership capacity in  performance management.  36. Departmental compliance with the performance appraisal system is monitored  through the human resources action plans. Systematic monitoring, reporting and  support have been provided to departments and offices with the goal of increasing  timely compliance with this critical component of the accountability system.       3.  Rewards, remedial actions and sanctions    37. Currently, with the possible exception of the within-grade increment, no  rewards are available for recognition of high-performing staff from an individual  performance management perspective. In respect to remedial actions and sanctions,  they can be applied either in cases of underperformance or deviations from the  principles and values that govern staff conduct and behaviour, which are contained  in the Charter of the United Nations, the standards of conduct for the international  civil service (see ST/SGB/2002/13, annex, sect. V) and the Staff Regulations and  Rules.  38. With reference to remedial actions for unsatisfactory performance, in the first  instance two performance ratings are currently available in the performance  management system to reflect ""partially meets performance expectations"" or ""does  not meet performance expectations"". For the former rating, managers are required to  ensure a comprehensive and detailed performance improvement plan for the staff  member, with regular feedback sessions. Two consecutive annual ratings of  ""partially meets performance expectations"" may lead to the withholding of the  within-grade increment. With reference to the latter rating, consequences may  include withholding a within-grade increment, non-renewal of a fixed-term contract  or termination for unsatisfactory service.  39.  With reference to sanctions for deviations from principles and values that  govern staff conduct, as contained in the Charter of the United Nations, the  standards of conduct for the international civil service and the Staff Regulations and  Rules, administrative inquiries and investigations may be carried out by the  following entities within the Secretariat: heads of office and programme managers;  the Department of Safety and Security; in peacekeeping missions the Special    A/64/640   35  10-22371    Investigations Unit, the United Nations Police component or ad hoc panels and  boards of inquiry; and the Ethics Office. These functions exist in addition to the  primary investigating role assigned to the Office of Internal Oversight Services in  accordance with mandates of the General Assembly. When the deviations do not rise  to the level of misconduct, but rather should be handled administratively, a  performance issue for example, the matter is normally handled by the department or  office concerned with the active support of the Office of Human Resources  Management. When evidence of misconduct is found (i.e., contravention of United  Nations regulations, rules and administrative issuances) following an investigation,  the case is referred to the Office of Human Resources Management to be handled in  accordance with the established procedures for disciplinary matters. Paragraphs 118  to 120 below explain how corrective actions are taken when wrongdoing is reported  by an oversight body.        V. Internal systems and controls      40. The objectives of the United Nations are clearly laid out in Article 1 of the  Charter. In achieving these objectives, staff members are obliged to respect  regulations, rules and policies and to follow processes and procedures, namely a set  of internal systems and controls that guarantee the Organization's correct  functioning.  41. These systems and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the achievement of the organizational objectives with regard to  operational effectiveness, adequate resource utilization, reliable financial reporting  and compliance with relevant regulations, rules and policies.        A. Regulations, rules and guidelines that establish how actions are to  be taken in the Organization        1.  Staff Regulations and Rules and the Human Resources Handbook    42. There is a well-established hierarchy of norms that govern all issues related to  the staffing of the Secretariat. The legal framework or hierarchy of norms of the  United Nations is composed of the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the administrative issuances, as described below.      (a)  Charter of the United Nations and the Staff Regulations and Rules    43. The Charter of the United Nations is the fundamental source of law in relation  to the staffing of the Organization. The Charter establishes the broad principles  regarding staff and further sets out the role of the Secretary-General in matters  concerning the management and administration of the staff.  44. The Staff Regulations for their part embody the fundamental conditions of  service and the basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat.  They represent the broad principles of personnel policy for the staffing and  administration of the Secretariat (ST/SGB/2009/6, Scope and purpose). The Staff  Rules, established and amended by the Administration, provide a detailed  elaboration of the Staff Regulations on matters related to staff rights, obligations,  duties and conditions of service. In the hierarchy of legal norms, the Regulations are  A/64/640      10-22371  36    at a higher level; specifically, the Staff Rules and proposed amendments thereto  must be in conformity with the Staff Regulations.  45. In case of conflict, the Staff Regulations prevail, and any provision of the  Rules that violates the Regulations will be disregarded. Further, any amendments  made by the Secretary-General to the Staff Rules are provisional until they have  been reported to the General Assembly, which may direct that the changes be  withdrawn or modified.      (b)  Human Resources Handbook    46. The Human Resources Handbook contains all Staff Regulations and Rules,  Secretary-General's bulletins, administrative instructions and information circulars  related to human resources management, which are cross-referenced to one another  through a system of hyperlinks. The Handbook is maintained electronically by the  Office of Human Resources Management and is posted on the United Nations  website (www.un.org/hr_handbook/English).      2.  Financial Regulations and Rules and the Finance Manual     47. The Financial Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) provide an overarching  single-source document for the financial management policies of the Organization.  These Regulations and Rules are the foundation upon which sound financial  management practices are built. Through the Financial Regulations, the General  Assembly issues the broad legislative directives governing the financial  management of the United Nations. Within the framework of the Regulations, the  Secretary-General formulates and promulgates the Financial Rules. The Rules  define the parameters within which staff must exercise their responsibilities.  48. The Financial Regulations and Rules allow for a systematic delegation of  financial management authority in accordance with the following understanding: the  Secretary-General delegates authority and responsibility for the implementation of  the Financial Regulations and Rules to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management. Authority and responsibility for their implementation is further  delegated by the Under-Secretary-General for Management in an administrative  instruction (ST/AI/2004/1) to the Assistant Secretary-General and Controller and to  the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  49. These Financial Regulations and Rules also lay out the responsibility for  management of both expendable and non-expendable property of the Organization.  This involves all systems for receipt, recording, utilization, safekeeping,  maintenance and disposal of assets.  50. All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in connection  with them. Any staff member who contravenes the Regulations and Rules or  corresponding administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and  financially liable for his or her actions.        Finance Manual    51. The Finance Manual is used in conjunction with the Regulations and Rules  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation and other relevant    A/64/640   37  10-22371    guidelines to ensure proper management of the Organization's financial resources.  The Manual describes all organizational procedures related to finance and budgetary  matters starting with the Charter, authority and responsibility for management, the  budget process, assessed contributions, extrabudgetary and voluntary contributions,  management of cash and investments, accounting and financial reporting,  procurement, audit and ethics.      3.  Procurement Manual    52. The Financial Regulations and Rules also regulate the Organization's  procurement processes.d Additional administrative guidance related to the  procurement function, staff and operations is included in the United Nations  Procurement Manual, which can be found at www.un.org/Depts/ptd/manual.htm.      4.  Administrative issuances    53. Other mechanisms used by the Administration to elaborate internal policies  and procedures and to communicate these to staff are the Secretary-General's  bulletins, administrative instructions and information circulars, in that hierarchical  order. These administrative issuances provide further information on regulations,  rules and policies of the Organization.      5.  Peacekeeping-specific manuals and guidelines    54. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field  Support have issued the following manuals and guidelines as additional internal  controls for peacekeeping missions: Surface Transport Manual: Procedures for the  Field; Aviation Manual; Liquidation Manual; Integrated Mission Planning Process  Guidelines; Property Management Manual for United Nations Peacekeeping  Missions; Contingent-Owned Equipment Manual; and Field Finance Procedure  Guidelines.        B. Organizational systems to ensure the functioning of the  United Nations        1.  Selecting and contracting of personnel      (a)  Staff members    55. Personnel are normally recruited and promoted to United Nations positions  through Galaxy, the Internet-based system that is used to advertise vacancies and  manage recruitment, selection and rostering of candidates. Successful external  candidates of national competitive exams and successful internal candidates of the  highly competitive G-to-P examination process can be recruited directly to base  grade Professional posts (P-2 level). All other recruitment and promotion is done  through the Galaxy system.  56. Recruitment, placement, promotion and mobility of staff are conducted in  accordance with provisions defined in ST/AI/2006/3/Rev.1. Vacancy announcements  are constructed by programme managers and cleared by the Office of Human  Resources Management before being posted on the Galaxy system. Starting on  __________________    d  In particular Regulations 5.12 to 5.14, and Rules 105.13 to 105.19 and 105.22 to 105.23.  A/64/640      10-22371  38    1 April 2010, vacancy announcements will be posted on the new talent management  system, Inspira. Generic job profile templates have been developed to simplify and  ensure consistency in the creation of vacancy announcements for most positions in  the United Nations system. After qualified candidates from the applicant pool have  been properly considered, a shortlist of recommended candidates is sent by the  programme manager to the central review bodies for review. The central review  bodies consider whether the recommended list, referred to as the ""proposal"", has  been developed in accordance with proper procedures and is consistent with  evaluation criteria previously approved by the body concerned. It also monitors  whether geographical and gender criteria have been taken into consideration.  57. Selection decisions are made by the head of department or office after the  central review body has indicated that the evaluation criteria have been properly  applied and procedures properly followed. The selection system is predicated on the  fundamental concept that heads of departments and offices, who are responsible and  accountable for delivering substantive results in their work programmes, must also  be responsible for taking the final decision on the selection of staff that will  implement those work programmes.      (b)  Contractors and consultants    58. Individual contractors are people engaged by the Organization from time to  time under temporary contracts to provide expertise, skills or knowledge for the  performance of a specific task or piece of work against payment of an all-inclusive  fee. A consultant is an individual who is a recognized authority or specialist in a  specific field engaged by the United Nations under temporary contract in an  advisory or consultative capacity to the Secretariat, whose skills or knowledge are  not normally possessed by the regular staff of the Organization and for which there  is no continuing need in the Secretariat. The employment of consultants and  individual contractors is governed by ST/AI/1999/7.  59. In making a selection, the department normally chooses one of at least three  qualified candidates and justifies the proposed selection before a special service  agreement can be processed by the department's executive office. Under  ST/AI/2006/3/Rev.1, section 5.6 (b), neither consultants nor individual contractors  may apply for or be appointed to any post in the Secretariat within six months of the  end of their current service.      2.  Segregation of duties    60. The Secretariat has in place a system of segregation of duties to strengthen  internal controls and reduce the risk of errors and irregularities. Under this system,  no single individual has control over all phases of a decision or transaction that  involves Organizational resources. This reduces the possibility that a single  individual can breach the regulations, rules or procedures causing financial loss to  the Organization.  61. Some of the most important systems for segregating duties in the United  Nations Secretariat are presented below.      A/64/640   39  10-22371      (a)  Central review bodiese    62. In the area of personnel selection, duties are segregated as follows: the head of  department or office is responsible for recruitment, selection and promotion of the  personnel under his or her supervision; and the central review bodies are responsible  for monitoring the integrity of the process that leads to identification and selection  of suitable candidates. This separation of functions is detailed in the preceding  paragraphs, where the roles of the different actors in the recruitment process were  explained.      (b)  Designation process     63. The designation process consists of a clearance procedure, independent from  the selection action, that is designed to ensure that all staff members that perform  significant functions in the management of financial, human or physical resources  have the requisite qualifications and experience to carry out the responsibilities  assigned to them. The designation process effectively establishes a dual  accountability mechanism in the Organization under which staff members  performing administrative functions report to their respective departmental heads,  but are also answerable to the Department of Management regarding compliance  with all relevant regulations, rules and procedures that govern their work. Over the  course of 2009 this process was the subject of a comprehensive assessment, with a  view to introducing a new, streamlined, quicker designation process.      (c)  Separation of certifying and approving functions    64. Under this system, all commitments, obligations and expenditures involving  resources of the Secretariat must be signed by a designated certifying officer.  Following certification, the establishment of obligations, the recording of  expenditures in the accounts and the processing of payments must be signed by a  duly designated approving officer. Both certifying and approving authorities and  responsibilities are assigned on a personal basis and cannot be delegated. A  certifying officer cannot exercise the approving function nor can the approving  officer exercise the certifying function for the same transaction.      (d)  Bank signatories    65. Bank signatories ensure that there are sufficient funds in the bank account  when cheques and other payment instructions are presented for payment, verify that  such payment instructions are properly drawn to the named payee and ensure that  banking instruments are properly safeguarded and destroyed when obsolete. Bank  signatories cannot exercise the approving functions, establishing an effective system  of segregation of duties whereby the staff member that processes or approves a  payment cannot be the same one that signs the checks on behalf of the Organization.  Bank signatory authority is assigned on a personal basis and cannot be delegated.    __________________    e  The Senior Review Group is the standing advisory body constituted to make recommendations  to the Secretary-General on appointments and promotions to posts at the D-2 level  (ST/SGB/2009/2).  A/64/640      10-22371  40      (e)  Requisitioning officer and procurement officer    66. With respect to the procurement process, the requisitioning function is separate  from the procurement function. A requisitioning officer prepares the comprehensive  description of goods or services to be procured and specifies a reasonable time  period within which the work or service is to be performed or delivered. The  requisition is then submitted to the procurement officer, who carries out the  remaining actions required by the procurement process without any intervention  from the requisitioning officer.    (f)  Committees on contracts     67. The most important procurement actions within the United Nations are subject  to a review by an independent committee. In accordance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules, the Under-Secretary-General for Management establishes  review committees at Headquarters and other locations to render written advice on  procurement actions leading to the award or amendment of procurement contracts.  These committees ensure that the proposed procurement actions are based,  inter alia, on fairness, integrity and transparency.       (g)  Property survey boards    68. Property survey boards are established in accordance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules to render written advice to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management in respect of loss, damage or other discrepancies regarding the  property of the United Nations. The property survey boards also determine the  degree of responsibility, if any, attached to any official of the United Nations or  other party for any loss, damage or other discrepancy.   69. Sales of supplies, equipment or other property declared surplus or  unserviceable are subject to the approval of a Property Survey Board (and not to the  decision of a single official within the Organization) and are based on competitive  bidding, unless the relevant Board decides otherwise. The same principle applies to  the disposition or disposal of assets of peacekeeping operations, which are also  governed by these regulations and rules. In this latter case, a report on the final  disposition of assets for each liquidated peacekeeping operation must be submitted  to the General Assembly.      3.  Delegation of authorityf     70. The authority of the Secretary-General comes from the Charter of the United  Nations, which establishes that he or she is the Chief Administrative Officer of the  Organization. Below this, four types of delegation of authority may be found within  the United Nations Secretariat: administrative, substantive, institutional and by  designation.  71. Administrative delegation refers to the authority delegated for the  management of financial resources, physical assets and human resources within the  Secretariat. This authority can be delegated on a personal basis to an individual or  by virtue of the staff member's functions within the Organization.   __________________    f  Important contributions to this analysis have been drawn from the Joint Inspection Unit report  entitled ""Delegation of authority and accountability Part II: series on managing for results in the  United Nations system"" (JIU/REP/2004/7, see A/59/631).    A/64/640   41  10-22371    72. The main source of delegation of authority on financial matters is the Financial  Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) of the United Nations. The Rules establish  that any staff member who contravenes the Financial Regulations and Rules or  corresponding administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and  financially liable for his or her actions (Rule 101.2). Accordingly, financial  management authority in the Secretariat is delegated to a staff member in writing on  a personal basis rather than by virtue of his or her office or functions. In the area of  procurement, authority is also delegated on a personal basis through a personal letter  of delegation of procurement authority; this also occurs in the area of physical  assets management.   73. In the area of human resources, a functional delegation of authority prevails.  The Office of Human Resources Management reviews the capabilities of human  resources officers and provides clearance during the designation process.   74. Substantive delegation refers to the authority delegated to heads of  departments for the implementation of the programme of work of the Secretariat.  This type of delegation is defined in the form of Secretary-General's bulletins,  which describe both the organization and structure of the department or office and  provide a detailed description of the substantive activities for which each  organizational area is responsible.   75. Institutional delegation refers to the extension of administrative authority to  entities away from Headquarters under the supervision of the Department of  Management at Headquarters. This includes the authority delegated to different  departments of the Secretariat, such as the five regional commissions, which have  been granted varying degrees of administrative authority in respect of both financial  (including procurement) and human resources matters. This is also the case with  peacekeeping operations and special missions, as well as with technical cooperation  projects for which varying degrees of authority have been delegated to executing  agencies.   76. Delegation of authority by designation refers to the authority that is  delegated by the Secretary-General, or another senior official of the Organization, to  a committee, task force or working group for the supervision or the implementation  of a task or set of tasks. The most important management-related committees  existing in the Secretariat include the Policy Committee, the Management  Committee, the Senior Management Group, the Management Performance Board  and the Steering Committee on the Implementation of Change Management  Measures  (see  ST/SGB/1997/5,  ST/SGB/2005/13,  ST/SGB/2005/16  and  ST/SGB/2006/14).        C. Guaranteeing fairness in the functioning of the Secretariat's  internal systems and controls        1.  Ombudsman    77. The Office of the Ombudsman was established in 2002 to provide a dedicated  mechanism for United Nations staff, wherever located, to informally resolve  employment-related conflicts in a confidential, impartial and neutral setting  (ST/SGB/2002/12). Where a particular dispute or set of issues reflects a systemic  problem, the Office may make recommendations for changes in policy or practice.  A/64/640      10-22371  42    The Ombudsman reports regularly to the Secretary-General on the activities of the  Office and raises relevant issues with management and staff to facilitate conflict  resolution. The Secretary-General submits an annual report to the General Assembly  on the activities of the Ombudsman.   78. In the recent reform of the system of administration of justice, the General  Assembly created a single integrated and decentralized Office of the Ombudsman  for the United Nations Secretariat, funds and programmes and the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (resolution 62/228). The new  Office, now known as the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services,  includes a Mediation Division and seven regional branches.      2.  Administration of justice    79. Beginning on 1 July 2009, the United Nations launched a new system of  internal justice. This new independent, professionalized and decentralized system of  internal justice is central to the effort to guarantee fairness and improve  accountability. The reform of the United Nations justice system was based on the  recommendation of an external panel of experts and consultations with staff through  the Staff-Management Coordination Committee. The structure of the new system  has been laid out in three General Assembly resolutions: 61/261, 62/228 and 63/253.   80. The new system consists of two pillars, one informal and one formal. The first  pillar focuses on resolving disputes through informal, that is, non-judicial, means.  The second pillar, the formal system, consists of two levels of independent judicial  review by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals  Tribunal.       (a)  Informal system    81. Although informal dispute resolution is not new to the United Nations, greater  emphasis and resources are now being dedicated to fostering a culture of informal  settlement. The new focus on informal dispute resolution attempts to solve problems  at an early stage, thus reducing the number of cases going to the formal system. The  United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services, including the Mediation  Division which has mediation resources in many regions, is at the centre of the  informal system. Mediation is an informal and confidential process in which a  trained mediator assists the parties to reach a negotiated settlement of their dispute.   82. Mediation and other forms of informal dispute resolution may be attempted at  any time in the process, even after a case is pending in the formal system. Judges of  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal may, with the agreement of the parties, refer a  case that is pending before the Dispute Tribunal to the Ombudsman for mediation. If  no settlement is reached, the case returns to the formal system for adjudication.  Negotiated settlements, once agreed and finalized, are binding on the parties. A  party can seek enforcement of a mediated settlement through a petition to the  Dispute Tribunal.      (b)  Formal system    83. The formal system represents a significant change from the prior, peer review- based system. In the old system, the Joint Appeals Boards and the Joint Disciplinary  Committees reviewed the facts of a particular case and made recommendations to    A/64/640   43  10-22371    the Secretary-General, who could accept or reject those recommendations. The staff  member could also appeal an unsatisfactory outcome to the United Nations  Administrative Tribunal, which issued a binding decision on the matter. This system  had become unworkable in the context of the much larger, operationally diverse and  decentralized Organization that the United Nations has become.   84. The new system attempts to address these problems through a two-tiered  judicial process in which judgements are rendered by qualified professional judges  assisted by professional legal staff. Professional legal officers represent staff  members in their appeals. Any staff member may appeal an administrative decision,  including the decision to impose a disciplinary measure, in the formal system. The  formal system consists of several components: the Office of the Administration of  Justice; the judiciary of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and United Nations  Appeals Tribunal; the Registries of the Dispute and Appeals Tribunals; and the  Office of Staff Legal Assistance. Each element of the formal system is independent  and professionalized.   85. In the context of the new system of internal justice, the General Assembly  established the Management Evaluation Unit within the Department of  Management. The purpose of the Unit is to evaluate managerial decision-making to  ensure that it is in accordance with the regulations, rules and administrative  issuances and to identify emerging trends and systemic problems so that  management can take swift corrective action.  86. With the establishment of the new system and the expansion of mechanisms to  guarantee fairness in the functioning of its internal systems and controls, the  Secretariat recognizes the need to better inform and educate staff members about the  roles of the different bodies to avoid confusion and the duplication of work by the  different systems and mechanisms.      (i)  The Tribunals    87. The United Nations Dispute Tribunal is a court of first instance, operating on a  full-time basis in Geneva, Nairobi and New York. The Dispute Tribunal is  comprised of five fully independent professional judges, three full-time and two  half-time. Judges are not staff and may not be appointed to any position in the  United Nations following the expiration of their judicial term. Registries established  in Geneva, Nairobi and New York support the Dispute Tribunal. The role of the  Dispute Tribunal is to examine the facts of a case. It may call oral hearings,  normally held in public. The Dispute Tribunal issues binding judgements, although  both staff members and the Secretary-General may appeal, in accordance with the  statute of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal.  88. The United Nations Appeals Tribunal is the second-tier court of review in the  new system. The purpose of this court is to review the judgements of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal for error, not to hear cases anew. The statute of the  Appeals Tribunal allows this Tribunal to hear appeals from either party when it can  be shown that the Dispute Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, made an error on a  question of law or procedure, or reached a manifestly unreasonable conclusion of  fact. Seven judges make up the Appeals Tribunal. Each has at least 15 years of  judicial experience in a national or international jurisdiction.     A/64/640      10-22371  44      (ii)  Office of Staff Legal Assistance    89. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance represents a substantial improvement in  legal representation for staff seeking to appeal an administrative decision or who are  subject to a disciplinary sanction. The Office has seven full-time legal officers  serving in Addis Ababa, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi and the New York main office.  While the Office represents a larger commitment to the principle that staff members  should have access to professional legal counsel and representation, it is anticipated  that the volume of requests may exceed office capacity and that some staff will need  to utilize volunteer assistance from serving or former staff members with legal  expertise.      (iii)  Office of the Administration of Justice    90. The wholly independent Office of the Administration of Justice, headed by an  Executive Director, is responsible for coordinating the overall functioning of the  formal system. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance and the Registries of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal are part of the  Office of the Administration of Justice, which has its headquarters in New York and  a presence, through the Registries and the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, in Addis  Ababa, Beirut, Geneva and Nairobi.      (iv)  Management evaluation    91. The management evaluation phase, a review of contested administrative  decisions conducted by the Management Evaluation Unit in the Department of  Management, is the starting point for any case in the formal system. This review  process allows the Department of Management to evaluate whether a contested  decision has been made in accordance with the regulations, rules or administrative  issuances.   92. If the Management Evaluation Unit determines that an improper decision has  been taken, management will ensure that the decision is changed or an appropriate  remedy provided. This stage allows management to correct itself or provide  acceptable remedies, reducing the number of cases that make their way to the formal  system. The management evaluation also allows management to spot problems of a  systemic nature, take corrective action and enforce accountability.        VI. Ethical standards and integrity      93. A key element of the accountability system is the ethical component --  specifically, the mechanisms, policies, principles and values that set the standard for  the conduct and behaviour of United Nations personnel. The core values and  principles governing staff conduct and behaviour are contained in the Charter of the  United Nations, the standards of conduct for the international civil service (see  ST/SGB/2002/13, annex, sect. V) and the Staff Regulations and Rules.   94. A new system-wide Code of Ethics for United Nations Personnel has been  developed and was submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  (A/64/316, annex). The Code of Ethics is a concise statement that clearly delineates  the fundamental values and principles applicable to the discharge of official United  Nations duties and responsibilities. In addition, there is a code of conduct, the    A/64/640   45  10-22371    standards of conduct for the international civil service, which sets out guiding  principles for staff comportment that is consistent with the status of international  civil servant.         A. Ethics Office       95. Pursuant to the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution  60/1), and in the context of overall management reform initiatives, the independent  Ethics Office was established in January 2006. The Ethics Office develops  standards, training and education programmes and provides confidential advice and  guidance to staff on ethical issues such as conflicts of interest. The Office also  oversees the ethics helpline, has responsibilities related to the protection of staff  against retaliation for reporting misconduct or cooperating with duly authorized  investigations, and administers the United Nations financial disclosure programme.       1.  Promoting ethical standards     96. The Ethics Office, in collaboration with the Office of Human Resources  Management, fosters training on ethics issues to strengthen and raise awareness of  ethics, integrity and accountability. The Office develops, reviews and adapts training  programmes and endeavours to integrate integrity and ethics issues into the broader  range of United Nations training and staff development activities, including  orientation programmes for new staff members.   97. The Ethics Office plays an important role in providing confidential advice and  guidance to individual staff members, staff groups, departments and offices. Staff  members may contact the Ethics Office to discuss actual, apparent or potential  conflicts of interests, such as those pertaining to outside activities, post-employment  restrictions or acceptance of gifts. The Ethics Office does not replace existing  mechanisms for reporting misconduct or for grievance resolution. Rather, it offers  staff members and management opportunities to seek advice, in confidence,  concerning potential ethical issues or conflicts of interest.      2.  Financial disclosure    98. The Ethics Office administers the financial disclosure programme in order to  maintain and enhance public trust in the integrity of the Organization. The primary  purpose of the financial disclosure programme is to ensure that potential conflicts of  interest arising from financial holdings, private affiliations or outside activities of  staff members can be identified, and to provide advice on managing such conflicts,  taking into account the best interest of the United Nations. This could result in staff  members being advised, for example, to take action such as divestiture of certain  holdings or to recuse themselves from a particular activity.   99. The initial financial disclosure programme came into effect on 1 January 1999.  However, the current bulletin on financial disclosure and declaration of interest  statements (ST/SGB/2006/6), which came into force on 1 May 2006, lowered the  monetary reporting thresholds and broadened the reporting requirements in respect  of staff members' spouses and dependent children. It also broadened the scope of the  policy to include all staff members at the D-1/L-6 level and above, staff (regardless  of grade) whose principal duties include procurement or investment functions, staff  with access to confidential procurement or investment information, and staff serving  A/64/640      10-22371  46    in the Ethics Office. Any staff member who fails to comply with filing obligations  under the disclosure programme is to be referred to the Office of Human Resources  Management for possible disciplinary action.   100. Since December 2007, the Secretary-General has encouraged the voluntary  public disclosure of financial disclosure statements by senior United Nations  officials (at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above). The voluntary public  disclosures of the Under-Secretaries-General and Assistant Secretaries-General are  posted on the Secretary-General's website.     3.  Protection from retaliation    101. The policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for  cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations entered into force on  1 January 2006 (ST/SGB/2005/21). This policy formalizes protective measures for  staff members under threat of, or experiencing, retaliation for duly reporting  misconduct in their working environment, or for cooperating with duly authorized  audits or investigations. If the Ethics Office finds that there is a credible case of  retaliation or threat of retaliation, it will refer the matter in writing to the Office of  Internal Oversight Services for investigation and immediately notifies the  complainant in writing. All complaints are handled according to specific procedures  ensuring confidentiality and prompt attention.       4.  System-wide coherence in ethics    102. The United Nations Ethics Committee (see ST/SGB/2007/11) was established on  1 December 2007 to establish a unified set of ethical standards and policies for the  Secretariat and for the separately administered organs and programmes. The  Committee consults on important cases and issues having United Nations-wide  implications raised by any Ethics Office or the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee.  103. The United Nations Ethics Committee exchanges information on policy  development and implementation with a view to fostering a coherent approach in the  application of ethical standards and policies in the United Nations. The Committee  pursues efforts to harmonize policies on protection and training, to coordinate  financial disclosure programmes and to review annual reports of member  organizations.         VII. Oversight roles and functions      104. Management is primarily responsible for monitoring internal systems and  controls to ensure that the Organization is able to accomplish its objectives in an  efficient and transparent manner. Oversight bodies have an important role to play in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring mismanagement and  corruption. In the performance of their functions, oversight bodies provide critical  support to management by independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of  these internal systems and controls. This section describes the accountability role of  the key oversight bodies of the Secretariat and discusses approaches and measures for  enhancing the timely implementation of oversight body recommendations.         A/64/640   47  10-22371      A. Oversight roles and functions in the United Nations Secretariat in  relation to accountability      105. The oversight functions in the Secretariat are carried out by the Board of  Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee.g A description of these four bodies follows.    1.  Board of Auditors     106. By its resolution 74 (I) the General Assembly established the Board of  Auditors to audit the accounts of the United Nations and its funds and programmes  and to report its findings and recommendations to the Assembly through the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The core  responsibility of the Board is in relation to financial and compliance auditing. The  Board is required, inter alia, to ascertain whether the financial statements present  fairly the financial position as at the end of the period and the results of operations  for the period then ended; the financial statements were prepared in accordance with  the stated accounting principles; the accounting principles were applied on a basis  consistent with those of the preceding financial period; and transactions were in  accordance with the Financial Regulations and legislative authority.  107. Additionally, the Board of Auditors is authorized under the Financial  Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) to conduct performance audits. In this  regard, the Board may make observations with respect to the efficiency of the  financial procedures, the accounting system, the internal financial controls and,  more generally, the administration and management of the Organization.      2.  Joint Inspection Unit    108. The Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations system is the only external and  independent system-wide inspection, evaluation and investigation body. It is  responsible to the General Assembly of the United Nations and similarly to the  competent legislative organs of those specialized agencies and other international  organizations within the United Nations system that have accepted its Statute  (General Assembly resolution 31/192, annex).   109. Through inspection and evaluation aimed at improving management and  methods and at achieving greater coordination between organizations, the Joint  Inspection Unit provides an independent view. It proposes reforms and makes  recommendations it deems necessary, issuing reports to the competent organs of the  organizations, with a view to assisting them in meeting their governance  responsibilities, and addressing notes and management letters to the executive  heads. Through its work, the Unit endeavours to help organizations improve  efficiency and effectiveness in achieving their legislative mandates and objectives,  identifies best practices and facilitates information and knowledge-sharing  throughout the system.    __________________    g  The Independent Audit Advisory Committee, as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly,  serves in an expert advisory capacity and assists the Assembly in fulfilling its oversight  responsibilities (see resolution 60/248, sect. XIII).  A/64/640      10-22371  48      3.  Office of Internal Oversight Services     110. The mandate of the Office of Internal Oversight Services is to promote good  governance and accountability in the Organization by providing independent and  objective oversight. The Office was established in July 1994 as an operationally  independent office to assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight  responsibilities in respect of the resources and staff of the Organization through  monitoring, internal audit, inspection, evaluation and investigation. The mandate  has been reviewed every five years as established in General Assembly resolutions  48/218 B, 54/244 and 59/272.   111. The Office of Internal Oversight Services assists the Organization in  protecting its assets and provides assurance that programme activities comply with  all relevant resolutions, regulations, rules and policies of the Organization. The  Office plays an important role in preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse,  malfeasance and mismanagement.       4.  Independent Audit Advisory Committee     112. Following the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly observed that  additional measures were needed to strengthen the independence of the oversight  structures and requested the Secretary-General to submit detailed proposals at its  sixtieth session on the creation of an independent oversight advisory committee. The  Secretary-General submitted those proposals in November 2005 (see A/60/568 and  Corr.1 and 2). In December 2005, the General Assembly decided (resolution 60/248,  sect. XIII) to establish the Independent Audit Advisory Committee as a new  independent oversight advisory body of the United Nations and as a subsidiary body  to the Assembly.   113. The Independent Audit Advisory Committee serves in an expert advisory  rather than operational capacity and assists the General Assembly in fulfilling its  oversight responsibilities. Specifically, the Committee is responsible for advising  the Assembly on the scope, results and effectiveness of audit and other oversight  functions, especially of the Office of Internal Oversight Services; on measures to  ensure management's compliance with audit and other oversight recommendations;  and on various risk management, internal control, operational, accounting and  disclosure issues. Additionally, the Committee advises the Assembly on measures to  increase and facilitate cooperation among United Nations oversight bodies.        B. Implementation of recommendations and identification of   systemic issues       114. To ensure timely implementation of oversight body recommendations, the  Secretary-General decided to amend the terms of reference of the Management  Committee (see ST/SGB/2005/6) to include as one of the core functions of the  Committee to ""ensure that findings and recommendations of the Board of Auditors,  the Joint Inspection Unit and the Office of Internal Oversight Services are  effectively fed into the executive management processes, and that accepted  recommendations are followed up and implemented in a timely manner"" (see  ST/SGB/2006/14).     A/64/640   49  10-22371    115. The Department of Management monitors departmental implementation of  oversight recommendations and reports the implementation status to the  Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The reports of the oversight bodies are  also fed into the intergovernmental process through the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions and/or the Fifth Committee. This enables Member States to make  informed decisions in regard to the accomplishments of the Organization and its  level of compliance with rules, policies and procedures.  116. The Department of Management seeks to strengthen its monitoring efforts by  gradually developing a capacity to conduct reviews of those systemic issues that  would benefit from systemic solutions. Systemic analysis would go beyond the  piecemeal approach of monitoring implementation of recommendations by  individual departments, providing the basis for comprehensive solutions to  Secretariat-wide problems and weaknesses. It is anticipated that reports identifying  systemic weakness and proposed solutions will be submitted to the Management  Committee on a periodic basis to obtain direction and decision from the Committee  regarding implementation of proposed solutions.  117. The oversight bodies also have an important role to play to ensure the  likelihood of the implementation of recommendations by: issuing recommendations  that include a clear and workable proposal for their implementation; providing  mechanisms that promote action and follow up on oversight recommendations and  foster discipline to pursue full and timely implementation; focusing on critical  issues with substantial impact on functional effectiveness in oversight reports and  avoiding an excessively large number of recommendations that may have a  ""crowding-out effect"" and stretch thin the Secretariat's capacity to respond; and  applying a consistent risk-based approach to oversight which will ensure that high- risk recommendations/areas are given priority.        C. Taking corrective action when wrongdoing is reported by an  oversight body      118. Based on the results of oversight body investigations into alleged misconduct  (i.e., contravention of United Nations regulations, rules and administrative  issuances), the Organization takes appropriate action (disciplinary or administrative)  against staff members. In certain cases where the reported conduct does not rise to  the level of misconduct but rather should be handled administratively, as a  performance issue for example, the matter is normally handled by the department or  office concerned with the active participation of the Office of Human Resources  Management. When evidence of misconduct is found (i.e., contravention of United  Nations regulations, rules and administrative issuances) following an investigation,  the case is referred to the Office of Human Resources Management to be handled in  accordance with the established procedures for disciplinary matters.  119. In those circumstances where there are credible allegations that a crime may  have been committed, cases go through a careful evaluation process from both a  legal and a policy perspective, before appropriate action is proposed to the  Secretary-General for his decision. Such action may include referral of a case to  national authorities of Member States for further investigation and/or legal action.  A/64/640      10-22371  50    Once a decision is taken to refer a case to national authorities, the Office of Legal  Affairs implements the decision accordingly.   120. Details of cases of proven misconduct and/or criminal behaviour are reported  annually to the General Assembly and to all United Nations staff members, in  accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/287.    A/64/640   51  10-22371    Annex II       Enterprise risk management and internal control framework        I. Introduction and definition      1.  Enterprise risk management is defined as a process designed to identify  potential events that may affect the Organization and to manage associated risks in  order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the  Organization's objectives. It is owned and executed by the Organization's senior  leadership and applied in strategy-setting throughout the Organization. An effective  system of internal control is an integral part of enterprise risk management.   2.  The present text proposes the adoption of an enterprise risk management and  control framework that embodies all the most critical features recommended by the  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,a the Internal  Control Standards Committee of the International Organization of Supreme Audit  Institutionsb and the Independent Steering Committee for the Comprehensive  Review of Governance and Oversight within the United Nations System  (A/60/883/Add.1 and 2). The main components of the risk management process are:  (a) internal environment; (b) consideration of risks and objectives; (c) event  identification and risk assessment; (d) risk response and control activities;  (e) information and communication; and (f) monitoring and assurance. These  elements are illustrated and described below.     Figure I  Enterprise risk management and internal control framework              3.  To implement the framework and provide an appropriate level of execution  oversight, the present document proposes that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and Control  Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management.       __________________    a  ""Enterprise risk management: integrated framework"", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission (September 2004).    b  ""Guidelines for internal control standards for the public sector"", Internal Control Standards  Committee of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (2004 and 2007).

Enterprise risk management and internal control framework         A. Internal environment      4.  The strong support and commitment of the General Assembly, the Secretary- General and senior management are essential for the establishment of effective risk  and control management processes. While a sustainable framework relies on the full  ownership and accountability of management throughout the Secretariat, it can only  be successfully implemented if it receives endorsement and consistent, visible  support from senior management. Risk and control management must be as well  supported by adequate resources at all levels of the Organization.  5.  As a first step towards the implementation of a comprehensive framework, the  Secretariat should establish an overall enterprise risk management and control  policy that articulates the purpose, governance mechanisms and principles that will  guide the adoption of the framework. The policy should be individually applied to  the different departments according to the level and context of risk and risk  assessment.   6.  The policy development will be guided by the following principles:    (a)  Embedding. Risk management should be explicitly embedded in existing  processes. Appropriate flexibility should be applied in the execution of strategies  and allocation of relevant resources through the proper consideration of the risks  that could affect the achievement of the objectives of each organizational unit and of  the Secretariat at the entity level;    (b)  Consistency. The Organization should adopt, as part of its decision- making process, a consistent method for the identification, assessment, mitigation,  monitoring and communication of risks associated with any of its processes and  functions;    (c)  Integration. The enterprise risk management and internal control  framework should be fully integrated with the major operational processes, such as  strategic planning, operational and financial management, and performance  measurement and management;    (d)  Management ownership. In order to increase accountability, risk owners  and management must have a sound understanding of the risks affecting their  operations and must have sufficient flexibility to determine the appropriate course  of action to manage those risks;    (e)  Risk-aware culture. A risk-focused and results-oriented culture should  be nurtured, moving the Secretariat from the current predominantly risk-averse  culture to a risk-aware culture, where decisions are driven by a systematic  assessment of risks and rewards;    (f)  Communication. Adequate information should be provided at different  levels throughout the Organization, to senior management, the Secretary-General  and the General Assembly. Together with the advice of the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Independent Audit Advisory  Committee, Member States and the Secretary-General will then be in a position to  effectively fulfil their respective governance and oversight responsibilities and to  take decisions on modifications of the internal control system.    A/64/640   53  10-22371      B. Consideration of risks and objectives      7.  The risk assessment process begins with a mapping of risks in relation to  underlying strategies, plans and objectives that will eventually be used to prioritize  risks and determine the required management and mitigation activities. To this end,  the Secretariat defines its risk universe, which includes a high-level description of  all of the risks relevant to the Organization. As a subset of the United Nations  Secretariat risk universe, each department, office, commission, mission and tribunal  develops its own risk catalogue, which should be tailored to reflect the profile of the  organizational unit under consideration. This process facilitates the adoption of a  common risk language that allows the Secretariat to collect and evaluate risk  information on multiple levels across the entire Organization in a consistent and  integrated manner. It also enables senior management to understand the impact of  various alternate response strategies on a system-wide basis, as well as to assess the  overall effectiveness of existing controls and measures of risk mitigation.  8.  The risk universe for the Secretariat developed in 2008 identified a catalogue  of 116 risks in five major risk areas: (a) strategic; (b) governance; (c) operational;  (d) compliance; and (e) financial (see table 1 below).  9.  All relevant risk information related to the risk assessment process needs to be  captured in a central repository, the Secretariat's risk register. It should include the  risk universe (the risk category, risk sub-category, risk and risk definition) and  information regarding rating results, contributing risk factors and drivers. Each unit  location should maintain the relevant subset of risks within the risk register,  reflecting any relevant changes in the risk environment. A comprehensive review  must be completed at least annually in conjunction with periodic risk assessments.  10. Following the definition of the objectives and scope of the risk assessment, the  Secretariat must determine the scoring criteria for the measurement of risks.  According to best practice, risks should be measured in terms of impact, likelihood  and control effectiveness. Impact describes the likely result or effect of an event.  Likelihood ranks the possibility that a given event will occur. Control effectiveness  rates the perceived effectiveness of the controls, processes and activities that are in  place to manage or mitigate a risk. In this context, internal controls are defined as  the processes that are executed by senior management to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the achievement of its set objectives. For United Nations  Secretariat scoring criteria for the measurement of impact, likelihood and level of  control effectiveness, see table 2 below.        C. Event identification and risk assessment       11. Potential events should be identified by collecting information from senior  managers and staff members in the organizational unit that is conducting the risk  assessment. This can be done through individual interviews, workshops, risk  questionnaires and surveys. Risks may also be identified through the review of  relevant other sources, including process flow analyses, audit reports, incident  reports and lessons learned.  12. Each of the identified risks will then be evaluated according to the previously  defined risk and control rating criteria. As a first step, each risk will be scored in  terms of the risk likelihood and impact, based on the information obtained through  A/64/640      10-22371  54    interviews, workshops, surveys or process analyses, without the consideration of  any existing controls established to mitigate the risk (inherent risk rating).  Appropriate input should then be obtained to assess the effectiveness of controls or  processes in place to mitigate the risk. The proper assessment of controls depends  on a thorough understanding of their intended purpose: that is, how they are  expected to reduce the likelihood or impact of a defined risk, and their operational  effectiveness.  13. The consideration of inherent risk exposure on one hand, and the level of control  effectiveness on the other, determines the level of residual risk.c Determinations of  residual risks should be validated in a dedicated workshop so that management can  share a common understanding of the identified risks and their criticality.        D. Risk response and control activities      14. The ratings for impact and likelihood resulting from the assessment of the  identified risks determine the overall inherent risk exposure, and following  consideration of the control measures, the residual risk exposure. The resulting risks  can be classified in three tiers:    (a)  Tier 1. The most significant risks require high-level attention, and as  such will be reported through the Management Committee to the Secretary-General,  and through the Secretary-General to the General Assembly;    (b)  Tier 2. Moderate risks typically require specific remedial or monitoring  measures under the responsibility of the risk owner and the local risk and control  focal point. These risks should be reported to the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section and the head of department or office responsible for the area under  assessment;    (c)  Tier 3. Risks that are expected to have a relatively low risk exposure and  a low residual risk should be monitored periodically to obtain assurance as to the  stability of the risk level.   15. The residual risk heat map, a four-quadrant chart depicted below, represents  the results of a risk assessment, and in particular the residual risks as a function of  risk exposure and level of control effectiveness. It can assist management in the  determination of appropriate risk treatment strategies and risk mitigation measures.    __________________    c  According to the definition provided by the framework established by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, residual risk is the risk remaining after  management has taken action to alter the risk's likelihood or impact, and should therefore be the  starting point for determining the appropriate treatment response.    A/64/640   55  10-22371        Figure II   Residual risk heat map                          16. The assessment outputs from the different unit locations should be compared  by the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section and measured against the  entity-level scoring criteria to provide an entity-level risk assessment result.        E. Information and communication      17. Relevant risk and control information should be provided with the appropriate  level of detail throughout the Organization to support decision-making towards the  achievement of established mandates and objectives. In particular, the risk profile of  the Organization and the effectiveness of the designed controls should drive  management's response plan activities and decisions, and should be considered in  setting the funding and resource allocation requests as part of the strategic  framework and budgeting process. In this manner, an effective enterprise risk  management and control process will become instrumental to the promotion of a  risk-driven culture through a more informed risk-based decision-making capability,  as the significance of risks and the effectiveness of dedicated controls will be  explicitly considered when evaluating programmes and relevant budget allocations.  18. The risks to be covered, the level of detail required and the frequency of  reporting may vary for different audiences and depend on their respective risk  management and oversight responsibilities. Programme managers responsible for  the management of specific risks at the local level should receive detailed  information covering their area of responsibility. Risk and control information  concerning risks deemed to be of the greatest significance should be provided in  summary form and on an entity-wide basis to the Secretary-General through the  Management Committee. The Secretary-General will report enterprise risk  management information to the General Assembly, as appropriate.         F. Monitoring and assurance      19. As the risk assessment process relies on management's perception of control  effectiveness, adequate assurance activities should validate the evaluation and  provide assurance with regard to the effectiveness of designed controls and the    Control  monitoring    Risk  reduction  Risk  monitoring  Risk  optimization or  acceptance High  Low  High  Level of  inherent  risk  Effectiveness of controls  A/64/640      10-22371  56    appropriateness of defined risk treatments. The local risk and control focal points  and the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section should assist management  with ongoing monitoring and reporting activities in this regard.  20. In accordance with its mandate, the Office of Internal Oversight Services will  be responsible for the independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the control  environment, including the periodic assessment and evaluation of the implementation  of an effective enterprise risk management and control framework. The Internal  Audit Division of the Office will also be responsible for the review of the results of  the risk assessments process, and will consider its outcomes in the context of its  audit planning exercise.  21. As part of its assurance activities on the financial reporting of the  Organization, the Board of Auditors will be able to utilize the results of the risk  assessment as an important element of its evaluation of the Organization's system of  internal controls.  22. Proper risk governance mechanisms are critical for the adoption of an effective  risk management framework. While the day-to-day management of risks and  controls will be the responsibility of all managers and staff members, overall  responsibility for the implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework in the Secretariat rests ultimately with the Secretary-General. At  the level of each department, office, commission, mission or tribunal, the effective  implementation of risk management and control practices will be the responsibility  of the respective senior official. As part of the existing senior managers' compacts  with the Secretary-General, each senior official should annually confirm, through a  certification report, their responsibilities for the establishment and maintenance of a  strong internal control environment as a result of the risk assessment process. The  General Assembly, with the advice of the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, provides  risk management oversight, ensuring that senior management adopts and maintains  an effective enterprise risk management and internal control framework.d         III. Implementation plan and timelines      23. From start to finish, the initial implementation plan, which will include the  establishment of the necessary human and technological resources, is expected to  take approximately two years. Assuming formal approval by the General Assembly  by December 2011, the initial implementation, comprising four phases, could be  initiated in January 2012 to be completed by December 2013 (see figure III). As the  process of performing risk assessment exercises in selected organizational units will  start according to a phased approach once the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section is established, it is estimated that it will take an additional three to  four years to fully implement and adopt the framework across the United Nations  globally, subject to the availability of the necessary resources.    __________________    d  A detailed description of the specific risk governance mechanisms, roles and responsibilities is  contained in a document entitled ""Enterprise risk management and control framework"" to be  submitted to the Independent Audit Advisory Committee in February 2010.

In paragraph 9 (k) of its resolution 63/276, the General Assembly requested  ""an explanation of how the measures to strengthen the Secretariat's accountability  mechanisms would address the significant flaws in terms of internal monitoring,  inspection and accountability regarding the management of the United Nations  oil-for-food programme"". The below assessment is prepared in response to that  request.        Oversight of the programme    2.  Although some of the deficiencies in the programme were outside the control  of the Secretariat, the Independent Inquiry Committee, in its reports,a identified  significant findings and weaknesses which, if addressed, would improve the way the  Secretariat conducts business. The present report looks at those weaknesses that are  under the purview of the Secretariat.  3.  At the outset, the Independent Inquiry Committee acknowledged the fact that  the United Nations was faced with extraordinary challenges, including political  considerations, in administering the oil-for-food programme. The Committee also  noted that the Secretariat was hampered in carrying out its functions under the  programme effectively because of the absence of a suitable administrative  infrastructure for dealing with the sudden demands of this exceptionally large and  complex ""temporary"" humanitarian programme.  4.  The absence of a formal risk management system in the Organization could  have contributed to a failure to address issues such the political risk faced by the  Organization in administering the programme. Political risk, as a component of  residual risks, is addressed within the context of the enterprise risk management  framework that is being proposed by the Secretary-General.        Oversight by senior management        Finding    5.  The programme suffered from a combination of an unclear reporting structure  and lack of supervision from top management and an independent response to and  investigation of reports of abuses and corruption in the programme. However, there  was no guarantee that more aggressive supervision by top management would have  prevented the abuses.        Assessment    6.  Although there is no guarantee, the Secretary-General believes that a proactive  risk management system would have encouraged closer monitoring of the  __________________    a  Interim report dated 3 February 2005, second interim report, dated 29 March 2005, third interim  report, dated 8 August 2005, and report on the management of the oil-for-food programme,  dated 7 September 2005 (vols. I, III and IV).    A/64/640   61  10-22371    programme and therefore mitigated the weaknesses described. With respect to the  unclear reporting structures, clearer lines of delegated authority would have led to a  clear reporting structure and associated lines of accountability.        Internal audit        Finding    7.  The Independent Inquiry Committee found that the resources committed  to audit of the oil-for-food programme were inadequate and hampered the  audit coverage. It also noted that several important aspects of the programme  (e.g., functions performed at the Office of the Iraq Programme headquarters  and elements of the oil and humanitarian contracts, including price and quality  of goods) were not reviewed by internal audit. Although the accounting and  financial reporting processes and the results of the administrative (ESD)  account were routinely audited by the Board of Auditors, the Internal Audit  Division conducted only one internal audit relating to the administrative  account.        Assessment    8.  Future programmes of this magnitude would benefit from an independent  assessment of the systems and controls that were lacking in the administration of the  programme. In addition, steps have already been taken to address the issue of  resources for the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The General Assembly, in its  resolution 60/1, decided that the expertise, capacity and resources of the Office in  respect of audit and investigations would be significantly strengthened.        Finding    9.  Reporting of the Office of Internal Oversight Services to the General  Assembly on programme-related matters was unsatisfactory, and reports were  not published in a timely manner and in a consistent format.         Assessment    10. General Assembly resolutions 59/272 on the Office of Internal Oversight  Services reporting requirements and 61/275 regarding the terms of reference of the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee have helped to enhance accountability in  the Organization.        Finding    11. The Office of Internal Oversight Services did not adequately monitor the  implementation of recommendations that had been accepted by management.  Similarly, prior to 2002, the Office of the Iraq Programme and the United  Nations Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI) did not  systematically monitor implementation of audit recommendations.        Assessment    12. The accountability framework recognizes the need to ensure prompt follow-up  to accepted recommendations from oversight bodies. To date, the Management  A/64/640      10-22371  62    Committee is responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are fed into the  management process.        Finding    13. The United Nations did not possess adequate means to resolve disputes  regarding the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the  scope of its audits. The OIOS Internal Audit Division deviated from ""best  practices"" through its inability to report directly to an audit committee or other  independent board, its failure to complete enterprise-wide risk assessments and  its lack of budgetary independence.        Assessment    14. The Office of Internal Oversight Services has since adopted risk-based  workplans. OIOIS budgets continue to go through a process similar to that followed  by the other departments. The major difference is that OIOS budget proposals are  reviewed and analysed by the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, which is an  independent body that reports directly to the General Assembly.        Finding    15. Resources committed to investigations were limited and requests for  additional resources from the programme were denied. Due to funding  limitations, the approach by the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal  Oversight Services in initiating programme reviews was merely reactive rather  than proactive. Only limited investigation was undertaken, either due to  absence of cooperation by the Iraqi authorities, or due to lack of funding and  other resources.        Assessment    16. It is part of the mandate of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee to  review the budgets of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. This process will  ensure that resources are adequately provided according to a risk-based approach to  management of oversight functions. See also response in paragraph 8 above with  respect to resource allocation.        Administration of the programme        Finding    17. The report noted that the actions of the Executive Director of the Iraq  Programme in soliciting oil allocations on behalf of an associate constituted a  grave conflict of interest and violated United Nations Staff Regulations and  Rules with regard to integrity, impartiality and independence. It further  asserted that the Executive Director of the Programme, together with his  associates, derived personal pecuniary benefit from the Programme, through  the receipt of cash proceeds from the sale of oil allocated to them from Iraq.  These parties were aware that illegal surcharges were paid to Iraq in respect of  such oil sales, in violation of United Nations sanctions and the rules governing  the oil-for-food programme.      A/64/640   63  10-22371        Assessment    18. The United Nations has since established the Ethics Office, which has  developed policies related to potential conflicts of interest, financial disclosure and  whistle-blower protection. These measures could prevent, or at least mitigate, the  recurrence of the cited violations.        Finding    19. The Secretariat's response to the surcharge and kickback allegations and  the oil smuggling activities revealed a pattern of inaction and inadequate  disclosure to the Security Council and the Security Council Committee  established pursuant to resolution 661 (1990).        Assessment    20. The proposed accountability instruments envisage building on the already  strengthened oversight regime to create a robust oversight function that addresses  failures of staff members to perform their duties in accordance with established  regulations, rules, policies and procedures.        Finding    21. Weaknesses in control and oversight contributed to corruption and the  United Nations agencies failed to investigate allegations of misappropriation of  funds, mismanagement or conflicts of interest.        Assessment    22. Current accountability instruments affirm that adequate internal controls and a  strong, independent oversight capacity are key to sound management.         Finding    23. There was an apparent absence of follow-up to audit findings and  recommendations by management; this was symptomatic of the lack of  authority and status for internal audit.         Assessment    24. Subsequent to the Independent Inquiry Committee report, the Management  Committee was established, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General. One of its  main functions is to ensure that recommendations of oversight bodies are effectively  fed into the executive management process and that accepted recommendations are  implemented in a timely manner. The Management Committee meets on a quarterly  basis to review the recommendations of the oversight bodies.         Programme implementation by United Nations agencies        Findings    25. Although the Independent Inquiry Committee acknowledged that the  United Nations agencies achieved crucial successes in the northern  governorates in managing a humanitarian crisis and distributing goods and  services throughout the region, it also found significant weakness as well. It  A/64/640      10-22371  64    noted that programme implementation by agencies disclosed notable failures  because they tackled problems beyond their core competencies, there was  insufficient management, coordination and oversight, etc. Agencies also failed  to successfully implement projects even though the projects fell within their  traditional spheres of competency, resulting in waste of resources and delays in  providing aid to the three northern governorates. In addition, the United  Nations Secretariat failed to adequately control and supervise the activities of  the agencies, and the programme's design did not allow for such control and  supervision. In addition, the Secretariat was reluctant to utilize the one tool at  its disposal -- the control over programme funds -- to manage the activities of  the agencies. Consequently, the Committee report notes that these weaknesses  in control and oversight contributed to corruption and the agencies failed to  investigate allegations of misappropriation of funds, mismanagement or  conflicts of interest.        Assessment    26. To address these monitoring shortfalls, the Secretary-General is proposing a  robust results-based management framework that will focus on achieving results and  improving performance, integrating lessons learned into management decisions as  well as monitoring and reporting on performance. This progress will be enhanced  through the results-based management information system referred to earlier, by  establishing the link between objectives, results and resources.         Procurement process        Findings    27. The Independent Inquiry Committee report noted that the selection  process for each of the three United Nations contractors selected in 1996 did  not conform to established financial and competitive bidding rules and did not  meet reasonable standards of fairness and transparency.  28. In one instance, the lowest acceptable bidder was not selected and there  was an absence of written justification by an appropriate official to reject the  lowest acceptable bidder as required by Financial Rule 110.21. In another  instance, the Procurement Division accepted an invalidly amended bid to lower  a contractor's contract price. In yet another instance, in contravention of the  established rules and procedures, factors other than technical and financial  considerations influenced the decision-making in awarding contracts.   29. The report further asserted that while an open bidding process did take  place, United Nations procurement rules relating to the qualifications of  prospective contractors were not appropriately followed: the contractor was  not asked to submit a required financial statement and no account was taken of  two criminal investigations against the Chief Executive Officer of the  prospective contractor. The report also pointed out that one staff member in the  Procurement  Division  provided  confidential  bid  information,  internal  assessments and selection considerations to a prospective supplier contrary to  the provisions of the United Nations Procurement Manual and the Staff  Regulations and Rules.      A/64/640   65  10-22371        Assessment    30. In the context of procurement reform, the Secretary-General introduced a  number of measures to strengthen internal control and promote ethics, integrity,  fairness and transparency in the procurement process, including the establishment of  an independent mechanism to review challenges to procurement awards. Together  with the current policies on financial disclosure, conflict of interest prevention,  whistle-blower protection and an enterprise risk management framework, these  measures would prevent, or mitigate, the recurrence of such a situation.        External audit        Findings    31. Resources committed to audit the programme were inadequate in relation  to its size.  32. The scope of the audit by the Board of Auditors was narrowly defined,  focusing particularly on the accuracy of financial statements, while the internal  control environment of programme activity received little attention.  33. External audits failed to audit and test some of the programme's most  critical areas -- including pricing of oil and humanitarian goods -- and to  assess their impact on the programme's financial statements.        Assessment    34. The envisaged enterprise risk management approach would help to identify  and mitigate risks. The Board of Auditors is an independent body and is solely  responsible for the conduct of its audits. However, Regulation 7.4 of the Financial  Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) provides that the  audits are to be conducted in conformity with generally accepted common auditing  standards and subject to any special directions of the General Assembly. Regulation  7.7 further provides that the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions may request the Board of Auditors to perform certain specific  examinations. With a robust enterprise risk management framework, the General  Assembly would benefit from the identification of high-risk areas, which could  provide additional guidance in identifying areas for possible special audits.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/71/729      General Assembly    Distr.: General  21 December 2016    Original: English      16-22682 (E)    090117      *1622682*      Seventy-first session  Agenda item 133  Review of the efficiency of the administrative  and financial functioning of the United Nations           Sixth progress report on the accountability system in the  United Nations Secretariat         Report of the Secretary-General         Summary    The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly a  report on progress made towards the implementation of the accountability system in  the United Nations Secretariat, as requested by the Assembly in its resolution 70/255.  The report highlights several critical components that have been strengthened over  the past year in areas related to internal controls, including: progress made in the  implementation of the enterprise risk management framework; the finalization of the  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat;  progress made in the implementation of a statement on internal control, in internal  controls in the procurement process and in accountability in field missions; and  improvements related to ethics and integrity and in the performance assessment of  the Secretariat's personnel. The report also describes how the major transformational  projects implemented in recent years continue to increase the visibility of crucial  information in the area of common support services, and how that can foster better  management and stronger accountability.              A/71/729      16-22682  2/23      I. Introduction      1.  The present progress report on accountability includes information on the  work undertaken by the Secretariat during the past year to strengthen areas related  to its system of internal control, as well as some of the additional actions in this  respect that need to be taken in the future. The system of internal control of the  United Nations is designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to adequate  resource utilization, the safeguarding of assets, reliable financial reporting and  compliance with relevant regulations, rules and policies. The report also explains  how some of the changes introduced by the major transformational initiatives, such  as increasing the visibility of the financial transactions of the Organization, are  fostering increased accountability and better management.  2.  In recent years, the United Nations Secretariat has successfully implemented  major change/business transformation initiatives, such as the International Public  Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), the global field support strategy, the  managed mobility system, Umoja and the capital master plan. Those initiatives,  while providing the opportunity to apply best management practices in various areas  of operation and to improve service delivery, have also introduced myriad changes  in the way the Organization works.  3.  For example, end-to-end process management is one of the most significant  changes brought about by the implementation of Umoja. It requires the Organization  to adopt a horizontal, cross-functional view of its administrative tasks in order to  fully achieve its objectives of improving productivity, lowering costs, reducing lead  times, increasing transparency and enhancing the quality of services. It is a new way  of working with increased specialization. It provides a major opportunity for the  consistent interpretation and application of all regulations, rules, policies and  principles related to the management of resources, increasing staff expertise in the  processing of transactions and reducing the number of errors.  4.  While prioritizing the full deployment and stabilization of Umoja in 2016, the  Secretariat recognized the existing linkages between the ongoing transformational  projects and the Organization's accountability structure as well as its system of  internal control.  5.  As mentioned above, the system of internal control of the United Nations is  designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to adequate resource  utilization, the safeguarding of assets, reliable financial reporting and compliance  with relevant regulations, rules and policies. Properly designed and functioning  controls reduce the likelihood that significant errors or wrongdoing will occur or  remain undetected.  6.  It is widely understood in the Secretariat that, following an intense period of  modernization and change, a series of tasks lie ahead in terms of change  management, ensuring accountability and strengthening the system of internal  control, and taking on such tasks will be a challenge. In that regard, it is worth  noting that the Secretariat continues to benefit from the observations and  recommendations of oversight bodies, particularly in respect of all completed and  ongoing transformational projects.        A/71/729    3/23  16-22682      II. Accountability and the strengthening of internal controls: a  continuous process       7.  As the objectives, standards and processes of the United Nations evolve over  time, strengthening its accountability system and the internal control framework  remains a continuous process for which there is neither a predetermined finish line  nor a set path to follow. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in recent  years towards that end, and at this juncture three important milestones are worth  noting.    (a)  Definition of accountability: at the sixty-fourth session of the General  Assembly, the Secretary-General submitted his report entitled ""Towards an  accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640). The Secretary- General's proposals submitted in that report led to the adoption of a definition of  accountability for the Secretariat by Member States. The definition included the  main components of the Secretariat's accountability system, and the decision of the  Assembly set a clear path for strengthening each of those components. The  Secretariat has since been reporting on the progress made towards that end through  its annual accountability reports;    (b)  Policy framework for enterprise risk management: a policy  framework for the implementation of enterprise risk management in the Secretariat  was approved by the Management Committee in May 2011 and submitted to the  General Assembly through the report of the Secretary-General on progress towards  an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/66/692), issued in  2012. The Assembly, in its resolution 66/257, welcomed the progress made by the  Secretary-General towards the development of the enterprise risk management  framework. Subsequently, an enterprise risk management methodology and a  governance structure were established that allowed for the implementation of a  Secretariat-wide risk assessment. Action plans to mitigate the risks identified  through the assessment were developed and are being implemented, as explained in  the paragraphs below;    (c)  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations  Secretariat: a critical element of any accountability system is an anti-fraud and  anti-corruption framework, which was missing until recently. The Anti-Fraud and  Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat was issued in  September 2016 to reinforce the Organization's commitment to building an  anti-fraud culture and maintaining high ethical standards. The Framework guides  staff members on the proper methods for reacting to and handling cases of  presumptive fraud, and serves as a deterrent for those tempted by an opportunity to  commit fraud or engage in corrupt acts.        III. Progress made in strengthening internal controls      8.  Enterprise risk management focuses on the Organization's risks and is at the  core of the Secretariat's efforts to identify the main areas that require the  strengthening of internal controls. Enterprise risk management fully incorporates the  internal control system; it does not replace that system. It provides the Organization  A/71/729      16-22682  4/23    with an ability to move progressively towards risk-driven management, once the  appropriate internal control systems have been put in place.  9.  During the reporting period, actions were taken to strengthen accountability in  seven key areas of management, as illustrated in the figure below: (a) enterprise risk  management; (b) the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United  Nations Secretariat; (c) the statement on internal control; (d) internal controls in the  procurement process; (e) accountability and field missions; (f) ethical standards;  and (g) the performance of personnel. Progress made in each of these areas is  briefly described in the paragraphs below.        Seven key management areas              A/71/729    5/23  16-22682      A. Enterprise risk management       10. The Management Committee identified six critical organization-wide risks in  2015 requiring priority in terms of the development of related risk treatment plans:  (a) organizational structure and synchronization; (b) organizational transformation;  (c)  strategic  planning  and  budget  allocation;  (d)  safety  and  security;   (e) extrabudgetary funding and management; and (f) human resources strategy,  management and accountability. Those risks were presented to Member States in the  context of the fourth progress report of the Secretary-General on the accountability  system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/69/676). Subsequently, action plans for  mitigating them were developed and the implementation of the action plans was  assigned to the designated corporate risk owners. The progress made by the  Organization in mitigating these risks during the reporting period is detailed below.         Risk 1: Organizational structure and synchronization       (corporate risk owner: Deputy Secretary-General)    11.  Opportunities provided by the three peace and security reviews (peace  operations; peacebuilding; and women and peace and security), the World  Humanitarian Summit and the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development and other key agendas (the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk  Reduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International  Conference on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement) continued to  be used to raise the awareness of Member States about areas in which the  Secretariat's structure might not be aligned with its objectives. Discussions on  making the United Nations development system fit for purpose, as well as the  identification of synergies, including a forthcoming review of agencies, funds and  programmes and a conflict prevention strategy, are under way.  12. Some actions were taken to reduce the existing ""silo mentality"" resulting from  the Secretariat's structure and to improve coordination, such as the refinement of the  2016/17 compact templates for senior managers at peacekeeping missions to better  reflect the multiple responsibilities of heads of offices.        Risk 2: Organizational transformation       (corporate risk owner: Under-Secretary-General for Management)     13. In respect of a vision and a target operating model for the Organization, the  framework for a global service delivery model was submitted to the General  Assembly at its seventieth session (see A/70/323). A refined and detailed proposal  of the Secretary-General in that regard was also submitted for the consideration of  the Assembly at its seventy-first session (see A/71/417). The benefit realization  plans for both Umoja and IPSAS are also moving forward as scheduled. On the  basis of the Organization's experience and lessons learned, general guidelines for  any new transformational project are also under preparation.  14. Additionally, in recognition of the interdependencies of the ongoing  transformational initiatives, a detailed common dashboard encompassing all of the  initiatives is regularly updated to ensure the integration of initiatives, the alignment  of key milestones and the recognition of synergies.    A/71/729      16-22682  6/23        Risk 3: Strategic planning and budget allocation       (corporate risk owner: Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General)     15. The proposed biennial programme plan for the period 2018-2019, submitted to  the Committee for Programme and Coordination, was based on an intense process of  internal consultations within the Secretariat. The revised programme plan reflects an  increased focus on results and impacts. For the first time, prior to its submission to  the General Assembly, the proposed budget outline for 2018-2019 was considered  by the Management Committee. The support account budget preparation process  was launched through a meeting chaired by the Chef de Cabinet with the heads of  all offices concerned. During these meetings, guidance on strategic priorities issued  by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support  was discussed. The progress made in the availability of increased financial  information to management for decision-making is described in section IV below.  16. Further progress in this area is linked to the implementation of Umoja  Extension 2, which covers the Secretariat programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and reporting cycle. The first deployment of Extension 2 is planned for  August-September 2018, which would cover the peacekeeping budgets for 2019/20,  the programme budget for the biennium 2020-2021 and voluntary contribution  activities commencing in late 2018 or early 2019.        Risk 4: Safety and security       (corporate risk owner: Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security)    17. The strategic review of the Department of Safety and Security was completed  in 2015, and related recommendations are being implemented. The integration of the  security resources of the Secretariat is under way, along with enhanced  communication to the field and clear policy guidance on management, human  resources and finances. Progress was made in implementing the strategic priorities  of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network, such as the increased  integration of security management with programme delivery, and the support  provided to security decision makers on crisis management. Progress was also made  in institutionalizing programme criticality as a system-wide policy.  18. A draft occupational safety and health policy was completed in respect of duty  of care, and work is under way to establish an occupational safety and health  governance structure for the Secretariat.         Risk 5: Extrabudgetary funding and management      (corporate risk owner: Controller)    19. Preliminary guidelines for the preparation of agreements with donors and  implementing  partners,  including  those  related  to  restrictive  conditions  (e.g., immunities and privileges of the United Nations, a single audit principle,  procurement and recruitment), have been issued. A set of minimum required clauses  for each agreement have also been established, including those related to donor  reports, annual reporting, evaluations and contribution payment terms. Corporate  guidance on standard procedures for the selection of implementing partners,  clarifying the differences between the process of selecting implementing partners  and the procurement process and between implementing partnerships and grants, is    A/71/729    7/23  16-22682    being formulated in consultation with programme managers and the Office of Legal  Affairs. Revised policies for the establishment and management of trust funds and  relevant administrative instructions are under review by the Office.        Risk 6: Human resources strategy, management and accountability      (corporate risk owner: Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources Management)    20. The report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Overview of human resources  management reform: towards a global, dynamic, adaptable and engaged workforce  for the United Nations"" (A/71/323), containing proposals for an integrated human  resources strategy, was submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly at  its seventy-first session. Subject to the approval of the Assembly, a detailed human  resources strategy will be presented at its seventy-third session.  21. A global staff survey is expected to be conducted in April 2017 to assess staff  satisfaction and concerns and to create a benchmark against which future progress  can be measured. On the basis of the outcomes of the survey, high-level goals and  an organizational vision for the Secretariat will be articulated and supported by a  comprehensive human resources strategy.  22. For information related to the action plans for mitigating these risks, see annex I.        The way forward    23. While work on the critical risks should continue according to the agreed  multi-year plan, in order to serve as an effective managerial and strategic decision- making tool, the risk register should be maintained as a living document that would  represent the evolving risk profile of the Organization. The register should, in  particular, be able to formally capture emerging priorities through periodic, formal  assessments.  24. The updating of the Secretariat-wide enterprise risk assessment will start in  2017. This will provide an opportunity for further dedicated discussions with the  new Secretary-General and the new senior management team and for the definition  of an updated risk register.   25. To support the implementation of enterprise risk management at the  department and office levels, the Secretariat recently developed a practical  enterprise risk management guide for managers. The guide includes tools and  templates outlining how departments and offices can implement an effective  enterprise risk management framework based on common policy and methodology.  The guide was formally distributed to all heads of departments by the Under- Secretary-General for Management and was also made available on iSeek. A  consistent Organization-wide framework and approach is essential to ensure that  results across the Secretariat are comparable and can be consolidated and reported  to the Management Committee and governing bodies, as required. Progress  regarding the implementation of enterprise risk management at peacekeeping  missions is detailed in paragraphs 42-46 below.  26. The implementation of enterprise risk management continues to be supported  by a comprehensive communications programme, including an e-learning course  available to all staff in Inspira (the personnel management system) and, beginning in  A/71/729      16-22682  8/23    2016, also through the United Nations System Staff College. At the time of  reporting, more than 2,000 staff members were enrolled in the course. The  communications programme also includes formal and informal presentations,  training sessions and workshops in various departments and offices; enterprise risk  management and internal control web pages on iSeek; and the enterprise risk  management community of practice on Unite Connections, which includes more  than 200 practitioners virtually representing all the areas and entities throughout the  United Nations system and several other international institutions.        B. Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat      27. The Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations  Secretariat was issued on 15 September 2016. The Framework includes definitions  of fraud and corruption as they apply to the Secretariat, together with concrete  examples of cases most frequently found in the Organization. It also describes the  expectations and responsibilities with respect to the prevention of fraud and  corruption for each actor concerned, from the Secretary-General downward; the  fraud prevention measures in place in the Secretariat; and the principles guiding  third parties in contractual arrangements with the Secretariat, including vendors,  suppliers and implementing partners. In addition, it clearly reiterates the  Organization's zero-tolerance approach to fraudulent acts committed by Secretariat  staff members.  28. The Framework is the cornerstone of an enterprise-wide campaign being  carried out in coordination with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the  Ethics Office. It includes the following activities:    (a)  The fourth Leadership Dialogue launched by the Executive Office of the  Secretary-General and the Ethics Office, on the topic ""Fraud awareness and  prevention: how do I fit in?"". The Dialogue is mandatory for all staff members at all  levels and was designed around the main issues included in the Framework;    (b)  An e-learning programme on anti-fraud efforts, entitled ""Preventing  fraud and corruption at the United Nations"" and planned by the Ethics Office in  coordination with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Office of Human  Resources Management. The course will be available to all staff starting in the first  quarter of 2017;    (c)  iSeek stories and anti-fraud pamphlets. The Department of Management,  through a story published on iSeek on 15 September 2016, reiterated that combating  fraud and corruption is a primary responsibility of management and staff at all  levels and requested all staff members to familiarize themselves with the contents of  the Framework. In addition, an anti-fraud pamphlet was distributed that emphasized  the zero-tolerance approach, the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the  anonymity of those reporting fraud, the obligation to report presumptive fraudulent  acts, where to report such cases and the disciplinary actions that the Secretariat  takes against staff involved in cases of fraud.   29. In addition, on 5 October 2016 the Secretary-General informed all staff  members in the Secretariat of the promulgation of the Framework and its purpose    A/71/729    9/23  16-22682    and requested them to make every effort to promote the highest ethical standards for  the United Nations.        The way forward    30. To comply with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 70/255, the  High-level Committee on Management has put together a task force whose main  objective is to work towards a single agreed definition across the United Nations  system of what constitutes fraud and suspected or presumptive fraud. The task  force, consisting of members from across the entire United Nations system and  co-chaired by the Director of the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme  Planning, Budget and Accounts of the Department of Management of the Secretariat  and the Controller and Director of the Division of Financial and Administrative  Management of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  will also work towards developing a common understanding with a view to  establishing partnership arrangements with implementing partners. It started  meeting in September 2016.  31. As the Board of Auditors noted in its report on the United Nations (A/71/5  (Vol. I)), the legal framework in place for working with implementing partners in  the Secretariat does not flow from the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations. The Secretariat considers these relationships to be primarily substantive  and collaborative partnerships. In entering into such partnerships, the United  Nations may transfer financial resources to these entities when it is in its best  interest to leverage their capacity to implement activities that support or supplement  mandated activities. It is not a requisitioning/vendor type of relationship, which is  governed by the Financial Regulations and Rules and the Procurement Manual;  neither is it a grantor/grantee relationship in which the grantee is provided with  resources as aid or assistance to implement programmatic output that is consistent  with the Organization's mandate.  32. To face this challenge, the Secretariat will modify its Financial Rules to  encompass such activities. Further down the line, it must also define the framework  under which such relationships will be managed. This will be done through the  issuance of an administrative instruction that will specify, at a minimum, the  Secretariat's definition of ""implementing partner""; a process for selecting  implementing partners that ensures transparency and fairness with appropriate  oversight arrangements and includes due diligence mechanisms in the selection  process; basic clauses for the corresponding agreements; and United Nations  principles to which they should adhere (e.g., child protection and environmental  safeguards).  33. In addition, the Secretariat is at the early stages of planning for a high-level,  top-down Secretariat-wide fraud risk assessment, which will be coordinated by the  enterprise risk management function in collaboration with an outside expert. The  study, which is planned to be finalized by mid-2017, will be based on tailored  enterprise risk management techniques and aligned with the overall enterprise risk  management framework of the Organization. To ensure the full participation of all  functional areas of the United Nations, the Secretariat has put in place an advisory  committee that is co-chaired by representatives of the Office of the Under- Secretary-General for Management and the Office of the Controller.  A/71/729      16-22682  10/23    34. The completion of the anti-fraud risk assessment will contribute to the  assurance process underpinning the statement on internal control (see paras. 35-39  below), covering one of the underlying principles of an effective internal control  framework. It will also address the implementation of some of the recommendations  issued on this subject by the oversight bodies, including on the review and  rationalization of the current suite of policy and guidance material on fraud and  other misconduct; the establishment of a central intake mechanism for recording  staff grievances and suspected fraud; and the development of an integrated strategic  approach to tackling fraud.        C. Statement on internal control      35. As outlined in the ninth progress report of the Secretary-General on the  adoption of IPSAS by the United Nations (A/71/226), the Organization is pursuing  the introduction of a statement on internal control based on an organization-wide  assurance process.  36. While work continues on the development of the required deliverables and on  defining the future global assurance processes, as a first step and as an integral part  of these strengthening efforts, an Assurance and Monitoring Unit has been  established in the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget  and Accounts. The Unit is responsible for undertaking activities aimed at providing  reasonable assurance over the reliability of data flowing into financial statements  and financial records. It regularly monitors transactions in Umoja, analyses  potential for error, detects irregularities and ensures appropriate corrective actions  by transaction owners or other stakeholders, as appropriate.  37. The roles assigned in Umoja are also reviewed periodically, which results in  recommendations to strengthen the segregation of duties, delegations of authority  and workflow rules in the system. An improved process flow will ensure that roles  requiring delegated authority are assigned in strict compliance with regulations and  rules of the Organization and in accordance with appropriate procedures.  38. In addition, the following actions will support the management of the  Framework: the provision of guidance to managers on using the planned self- assessment checklists and the correction of any future internal control deficiencies  found, and the preparation of monitoring dashboards to assess the performance of  client departments, offices and missions.  39. In addition, to strengthen accountability, track data integrity and support  compliance with related performance indicators, dashboards are being released for  individual departments, offices and missions depicting the status of their  transactions in terms of both monetary value and number of operations (including  errors) relative to the total volume of transactions during one year.         D. Internal controls in the procurement process      40. To enhance internal controls in the tender submission process, the  Procurement Division launched an e-tendering pilot project in 2014. The Division  continues to realize the benefits of e-tendering, which include the delivery of tender    A/71/729    11/23  16-22682    documents to invited vendors through their United Nations Global Marketplace  accounts; the efficient and secure transmission of tender questions, answers and  acknowledgements; and the Global Marketplace-integrated submission of offers by  the suppliers and the electronic opening of suppliers' submissions.   41. Annual self-evaluation and assessment reviews performed at Headquarters and  at the missions are yet another way to strengthen internal controls. Reports  containing recommendations aimed at enhancing adherence to the Financial  Regulations and Rules, the Procurement Manual and other administrative  instructions, and internationally recognized best practices in procurement, are  shared with administrative and functional heads. Since 2007, in addition to the  annual self-evaluation reviews conducted at Headquarters, a total of 71 assessment  reviews have been completed at peacekeeping missions. By strengthening the  internal control framework for procurement activities, the Organization mitigates  the risk and impact of inefficiencies, ethical violations and other improprieties.        E. Accountability and internal controls at peacekeeping missions         1.  Letters of representation     42. Directors and chiefs of mission support, as chief fiduciaries of peacekeeping  operations, continue to be required to submit letters of representation stating that  they have properly exercised the delegation of authority granted to them in  compliance with the Organization's regulations, rules and administrative issuances.  All letters of representation received from peacekeeping operations indicate that  chief fiduciaries have managed the resources placed under their stewardship in  compliance with the applicable United Nations regulations and rules.      2.  Conduct and discipline    43. Peacekeeping and special political missions continue their efforts to prevent  and respond to all forms of misconduct, in particular sexual exploitation and abuse,  by their personnel. This remains a high priority. Peacekeeping and special political  missions continue to implement the programme of action, which was initially set out  in the 2015 report of the Secretary-General on special measures for protection from  sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (A/69/779). Further augmented measures,  together with a series of initiatives, designed to strengthen prevention, enforcement  and assistance to victims were provided in the subsequent report of the Secretary- General on that topic (A/70/729). A number of these initiatives are aimed at  strengthening accountability at the individual, managerial/command and leadership  levels. A full update will be provided in the context of the next report of the  Secretary-General on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and  sexual abuse, to be issued during the second resumed part of the seventy-first  session.  44. The Department of Field Support continues to monitor the implementation of  the policy on accountability for conduct and discipline in field missions, adopted by  the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and  the Department of Field Support in August 2015. The policy sets out the structure  that is in place to ensure accountability for the conduct and discipline of all  personnel serving at peacekeeping and special political missions. The policy is  A/71/729      16-22682  12/23    complemented by an accountability framework that details the methodology for the  assessment of the accountability of field missions and their senior managers, as well  as corresponding support to be provided by conduct and discipline personnel,  through a series of indicators and corresponding expectations concerning the  performance of activities related to prevention, enforcement and remediation.  45. At the beginning of 2016, electronic reporting templates were introduced for  the quarterly and annual reports submitted by peacekeeping missions as required  under the policy and accountability framework. Those templates include streamlined  and more targeted questions, allowing for the collection of more accurate data on  relevant indicators, which, once analysed, enable feedback to be provided to  peacekeeping missions on issues of concern and best practices identified in  connection with the indicators.  46. Annual quality assurance exercises, regular updating of the status of open  cases and the re-examination of possible reasons for delay or inaction have led to a  significant reduction in the number of reported cases of misconduct awaiting action.  In February 2016, the technical interface was activated between the Misconduct  Tracking System maintained by the Department of Field Support and the system  used by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for the deployment of military  and police contingent personnel, to allow vetting for prior misconduct against  information recorded in the System. With vetting now being done for military and  police contingent personnel, all personnel deployed at peacekeeping and special  political missions are now subject to the same vetting process, which is designed to  ensure that personnel previously found to have committed misconduct do not serve  again in the United Nations.      3.  Enterprise risk management at peacekeeping missions    47. During the past year, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the  Department of Field Support completed the first phase of the implementation of  enterprise risk management. During this phase, three peacekeeping missions (the  United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the United Nations Mission in Liberia  and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo) and the United  Nations Global Service Centre initiated risk treatment plans to respond to the risks  identified in the risk registers. Implementation at the United Nations Support Office  in Somalia was delayed, owing to a change in mandate pursuant to Security Council  resolution 2245 (2015), for which an additional assessment was required to take into  account the revised mandate. The Departments also conducted the annual workshop  for mission risk management focal points at the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe,  Uganda, in April 2016. The workshop was attended by 29 participants from  peacekeeping operations, special political missions, the Global Service Centre and  the Regional Service Centre.  48. During 2017, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department  of Field Support will continue the phased implementation of enterprise risk  management,  with  emphasis  placed  on  missions  operating  in  high-risk  environments, particularly those in the start-up and transition phases. Both  Departments have taken measures to strengthen risk management capacities at  missions, including developing terms of reference for Risk Management Officers  and Compliance Officers and the mission enterprise risk management committee;    A/71/729    13/23  16-22682    establishing rosters for Risk Management Officers and Compliance Officers; and  advising peacekeeping operations to assess their risk management capacity and  submit a proposal for resource requirements for the financial period 2017/18.        F. Improving ethical standards      49. During the reporting period, the Ethics Office received more than 1,100  requests for services, which included 622 requests for confidential ethics advice, the  highest number ever recorded. The trend of growing numbers of requests by staff  members for advice on the Organization's ethical standards indicates their  commitment to ethics and integrity. Upon request, the Office also continued to  provide advice on due diligence, reputational risk and best practices in  anti-corruption programmes in procurement. The Office regularly assists in  establishing and implementing measures to enhance pre-appointment reviews of  senior positions for conflicts of interest. The Director of the Office continued to  conduct confidential ethics induction briefings for incoming and newly appointed  officials at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels.  50. For the 2015 confidential financial disclosure exercise, the external reviewers  identified and advised on 194 items of potential conflicts of interest. The review  was based on 5,440 staff members from participating agencies, with an overall  compliance rate of 99.9 per cent. In addition to meeting their confidential financial  disclosure requirements, 111 of 152 senior officials (73 per cent) participated in the  2015 voluntary public financial disclosure, compared with 103 of 151 (68 per cent)  in 2014.   51. In relation to requirements under the newly adopted IPSAS, the Ethics Office  provided significant support in developing relevant methodology for vetting key  management personnel of the Secretariat for conflicts of interest in respect of  related-party transactions. The Office completed vetting exercises pertaining to such  officials during two review cycles. The Office also completed preliminary reviews  of 23 claims of retaliation for protected activities and determined 6 of them to be  prima facie cases.        G. Improving the performance of personnel      52. The General Assembly, in its resolution 70/255, requested the Secretary- General to implement specific measures to strengthen the accountability system as it  relates to the performance of staff, emphasizing the performance of senior  managers.       1.  Senior managers' compacts    53. The senior managers' compacts detail -- in a clear, transparent and precise  manner -- the major areas of responsibility for senior leadership in the Secretariat,  in terms of both the unique programmatic responsibilities of each senior manager  and the standard managerial duties applicable to all of them. The responsibilities  described therein pertain to management at all levels and, ultimately, to staff and are  reflected in their annual workplans. Although it is subject to change by the incoming  A/71/729      16-22682  14/23    Secretary-General, the template for the 2016 compacts included the following areas  of responsibility:    (a)  Delivery of expected results towards the unique programme objectives  contained in the biennial programme budgets and, if relevant, the support account  and peacekeeping budgets;    (b)  Delivery of three to five high-priority results that are specific to each  senior manager and that help him or her to implement a programme or longer-term  objectives;    (c)  Implementation of the annual deliverables required by the multi-year  management reform agenda, which in 2016 fell into the following categories:    (i)  Deployment/consolidation/stabilization of Umoja;    (ii) Development of a global service delivery model;    (iii) Compliance with and sustainability of IPSAS;    (iv) Compliance with the information and communications technology  strategy, including its governance, policies and processes;    (v)  Requirements related to the launch of mobility;    (vi) Risk management;    (d)  Financial resources management;    (e)  Human resources management;    (f)  Implementation of oversight body recommendations;    (g)  Timely issuance of official documentation;    (h)  Compliance with regulations and rules;    (i)  Compliance with ethical standards.        Senior managers' compact for heads of mission    54. In response to a recommendation of the High-level Independent Panel on  Peace Operations, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department  of Field Support have refined the template of the 2016 senior managers' compact for  heads of mission to reflect their overall responsibilities. The refinements include:  (a) a new objective on gender mainstreaming, as requested by the Security Council  in its resolution 2242 (2015); (b) strengthened language on conduct and discipline to  reflect the introduction of the accountability framework on conduct and discipline  and the related reporting requirements; and (c) a new commitment in the area of the  environment to reflect the requirement to integrate and mainstream environmental  planning considerations into mission operations.        Compact assessments     55. Through  the  annual  compact  assessment  process,  the  Management  Performance Board identified compliance with recruitment timelines as a systemic  area of weakness for senior managers, and therefore asked the Office of Human  Resources Management to conduct a review of the recruitment process to identify    A/71/729    15/23  16-22682    bottlenecks. The Office found that manual screening and the often high numbers of  applicants were significant problems for hiring managers.   56. As a result of that finding, and as indicated in the report of the Secretary- General on the overview of human resources management reform (A/71/323), the  Secretary-General piloted a centrally administered assessment project with the goal  of reducing the recruitment timeline, in particular the time taken by hiring managers  to recommend candidates. As explained in paragraph 39 of the report, the project  entailed the introduction of an unproctored Internet-based preselection test for  eligible candidates for specific job openings within the Management and  Administration Network (MAGNET). As part of the project, the candidates screened  in by Inspira on the basis of eligibility requirements were invited to the preselection  test. Those candidates who passed the preselection test had their suitability screened  by hiring managers. Through that approach, the number of applicants who had to be  reviewed by hiring managers was reduced by 50 per cent before long- and shortlists  of candidates were established, and the time taken to recommend candidates was  thus cut down by a significant margin. Furthermore, as reported in paragraph 41 of  the report, the Secretary-General plans to expand the use of Internet-based  preselection tests, as their use has proved most effective when applied to job  openings that draw high numbers of applicants. This assessment approach is  currently being applied to the job openings within the new staff selection and  managed mobility system under administrative instruction ST/AI/2016/1.   57. Another systemic weakness identified through the annual compact assessment  process relates to the representation of women, in particular at senior levels. To  address this issue, the new 2030 gender equality and parity strategy, which is aimed  at achieving 50/50 gender representation in the Professional and higher categories  by 2030, requires a new methodology for determining gender targets in the senior  managers' compacts. Whereas the current methodology bases the annual customized  targets on each department's or office's performance in the previous cycle, the new  methodology will identify annual targets that clearly lead to 50/50 parity. The Office  of Human Resources Management will proactively provide data to departments and  offices that demonstrate opportunities for improvement, for example, by identifying  anticipated retirements.      2.  Performance management of staff at all levels     58. As detailed in paragraphs 77 to 95 of the recent report of the Secretary- General on the overview of human resources management reform (A/71/323), a  two-phased approach to reforming performance management is proposed. In that  approach, first the credibility and reliability of performance evaluations are  strengthened and, subsequently, performance becomes an explicit criterion that  determines the career progression of staff members and managers. In phase one,  which is expected to be implemented between 2017 and 2019, the Secretary-General  proposes to focus on three areas for improvement of the accuracy and credibility of  performance evaluations: (a) improving the ability of managers to manage  performance; (b) providing increased human resources expertise and support; and  (c) increasing the objectivity, transparency and consistency of the performance  management system (see A/71/323, para. 85).  A/71/729      16-22682  16/23    59. Phase two of the performance reforms would begin in 2019, involving the  revision of policies on performance management, staff selection and related areas to  explicitly include performance as a key criterion for lateral placement under  managed mobility and promotion of staff members and any performance incentives  recommended by the Assembly (see A/71/323, para. 95).  60. In support of those efforts, performance management data have been made  available to all departments, offices and missions through the publication of a pilot  end-of-cycle report, supported by the new performance management dashboard  launched in HR Insight in 2015. The end-of-cycle report is a mechanism by which  managers and staff can see overall trends in the Secretariat in terms of completion  rates and rating distribution. It highlights rating trends and patterns, by level and  entity. The aim of such transparency is to enable individual managers and staff, as  well as senior management teams, staff unions and others, to have real data and  foster more objective discussions on how ratings are given. Comparative data from  across the Secretariat will help to inform the discussions of senior managers and  provide guidance on how ratings may need to change in their own departments.  61. Additional efforts are focused on strengthening the role of senior management  with the roll-out of the organizational leadership model, which sets out clear  expectations for managers with regard to how to manage their staff, depending on  their roles in the Organization. Managers will be held accountable not only for  completing the e-performance document, but also for truly managing their staffs. The  Secretary-General is also ensuring that all incoming Assistant Secretaries-General  and Under-Secretaries-General are briefed on the importance of accountability for  effective performance management in their departments/offices/missions and of  complying with established timelines.  62. To support the implementation of the Performance Management and  Development System, the Secretary-General continued the roll-out of a more  targeted and streamlined version of the mandatory Performance Management and  Development  Learning  Programme  for  Managers  and  Supervisors  (see  ST/SGB/2011/5). Since January 2015, when the revised Programme was launched,  more than 3,000 staff members have been trained, 57 of whom have been Directors  and 18 of whom have been Assistant Secretaries-General and Under-Secretaries- General. The Programme reinforces best practices in performance management and  emphasizes the linkage between individual workplans and mandates of the  Organization, as well as the need to effectively address underperformance. The  Programme belongs to a suite of supervisory and managerial development  programmes that are aimed at, inter alia, increasing managerial accountability. In  order to ensure maximum accessibility and continuous learning, an e-learning  version for staff at large was launched in 2016.      3.  Taking corrective actions    63. As an internal check on managerial decision-making, the Management  Evaluation Unit has continued to conduct impartial and objective evaluations of  administrative decisions to assess whether they were made in accordance with the  relevant regulations and rules, and has made recommendations for remedies or the  initiation of accountability measures, where appropriate.     A/71/729    17/23  16-22682    64. The Management Evaluation Unit has also provided advice and guidance on  the relevant regulations, rules and jurisprudence, including through outreach  missions, video- or teleconferencing, participation in Office of Human Resources  Management training on performance management and the publication of lessons- learned guides. In 2016, the Unit published volumes 4 (performance management  and development) and 5 (managing organizational change (retrenchment,  restructuring, downsizing and abolition of posts)) of its lessons-learned guides.  65. In respect of the disciplinary measures handled by the Office of Human  Resources Management, from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 a total of 67 disciplinary  actions were taken regarding 67 staff members in 63 incidents. The three largest  categories of incidents were related to fraud or misrepresentation (20 cases, or  30 per cent), theft or misappropriation (13 cases, or 19 per cent) and assault or  abusive conduct (10 cases, or 15 per cent).   66. Of the 20 staff members involved in cases of fraud or misrepresentation, 16  were either dismissed or separated from service and 4 were subjected to other  disciplinary measures (including demotion, loss of step(s), fine and censure). Of the  15 staff members involved in theft or misappropriation, 14 were either dismissed or  separated from service and 1 was subjected to other disciplinary measures. Of the 11  staff members facing charges of assault or abusive conduct, 10 were either  dismissed or separated from service and 1 was subjected to other disciplinary  measures.  67. For further details, see annex II.        IV. Increased financial information available for the  management of common support services        A. Budget and finance      68. Umoja Extension 1 has already brought about significant improvements in the  availability of information for better decision-making. It provides real-time  information on budget consumption and fund availability across entities and funding  sources, and, as a result, the Organization has a better view of its spending. The  forthcoming Umoja Extension 2 will include the cycle of programme planning,  budgeting, monitoring of programme implementation and reporting.   69. With regard to extrabudgetary resources, Umoja serves as a central repository  of all contribution agreements and permits the visibility of current and future  inflows. Umoja has strengthened compliance with donor agreements, improved  tracking of the performance of implementing partners, automated the allocation of  interest to grants and provided capability for improved management of programmes  and projects. Umoja has also allowed for improved tracking of implementing  partners; the Secretariat is now able to capture the agreements with its implementing  partners, which assists in monitoring their performance and settling financial  transactions.  70. Business intelligence reports have also been made available in Umoja to assist  departments and offices in monitoring their expenditures and planning their work  for a particular financial period. These reports cover, for example, budget  A/71/729      16-22682  18/23    performance and vacancies by leveraging information and data from Umoja and  Inspira to provide a picture of the financial situation of a given budget section. The  availability of ""obligation"" reports in the current system allows entities to monitor  open and closed commitments (obligations) during a financial period to ensure that  the committed funds are used during that period.  71. The financial statements module, which serves as the backbone for compliance  with IPSAS, was launched for peacekeeping operations in August 2016. The module  was designed to automate the preparation of financial statements using Umoja, to  replace a cumbersome process across several systems and multiple spreadsheets and  Word documents, and to reduce the possibility of errors. The module will be applied  to all other operations in January 2017.        B. Human resources      72. Umoja has brought about real-time visibility with respect to global personnel  data. It is now an important consolidated source of operational information  concerning human resources. HR Insight, which has provided staff demographic  information (including on desirable ranges, staff list by nationality and composition  by gender) to Member States since its introduction in 2011, continues to be  enhanced to meet evolving human resources needs.   73. HR Insight is also used to report on how the Organization is performing in  respect of the five strategic management indicators included in the human resources  management scorecard. This accountability and monitoring framework has been  designed to help managers achieve their human resources management objectives  with regard to a number of indicators, including the five strategic indicators, related  to gender equality, geographical representation, vacancy rates, staffing timeline and  performance management compliance. HR Insight also contains a number of  operational reports for specific business units, such as the Field Personnel Division  of the Department of Field Support, and on e-learning and performance  Management.  74. In addition, the Secretariat continues its practice of making available on iSeek  most senior managers' compacts and their corresponding assessments.        C. Central support services        1.  Real estate module in Umoja    75. The implementation of the Umoja real estate module has provided the  Secretariat with an accurate and comprehensive view of the owned, leased and  donated right-to-use real estate holdings of the Organization, across all duty stations  and field missions. The availability of centralized real estate data, with increased  visibility and access to real-time transactions, ensures better management and  improved decision-making in the area of real estate. It is now clear that the  Organization's real estate portfolio is managed by 65 entities with a footprint in 150  countries, consisting of 47,000 architectural objects, including some 5,800 buildings  and 1,890 sites. The management of these data in the Umoja real estate module  requires the use of common terminology, metrics, measures and contractual terms,    A/71/729    19/23  16-22682    which bring greater homogeneity to the related administrative processes and bring  the Organization closer to achieving the goal of ""one United Nations"".   76. In addition, lease administration is being carried out in a standardized manner  in all locations and there is full visibility of all cost recovery transactions. For  example, a single report generated through Umoja shows that in 2016 the United  Nations managed more than 1,200 active leases, including 311 lease-out contracts,  under which the United Nations is the landlord, with projected annual rental income  of $30,879,770.  77. The Umoja real estate management module also meets IPSAS requirements  with respect to disclosure, capitalization, depreciation and asset disposal. This is  achieved by tracking all United Nations assets using a centralized database and  managing an end-to-end process that ranges from the solicitation and bidding  exercise to the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life.      2.  Travel management     78. An integrated global system provides for real-time analysis of travel  information and costs. Users and travel managers can better assess performance  through standardized key performance indicators, gain access to airline ticket prices  and itineraries, and see average costs per ticket, top routes and costs per transaction.  Users can monitor advance purchases of tickets, gain access to global price  information with respect to airline tickets, make more informed and cost-effective  decisions, and reduce delays in the processing of travel requisitions. Travel  regulations, rules and policies are embedded in the global system to support  compliance.      3.  Procurement    79. Umoja has allowed for the implementation of a global procurement operating  model in the Secretariat. Through master data management, 31,000 unique suppliers  for all Secretariat entities are currently consolidated in a common database. A global  commercial suppliers' database, combined with rigorous codification of the types of  goods and services procured by the Organization, reinforces transparency in  procurement. It also improves opportunities for negotiating more favourable terms  for the Organization. The Procurement Division has harmonized contracting  documentation (purchase orders and solicitation documentation) into a single form  used in all locations, and has created a global system that processes the workflow  regardless of locations and organizational units.  80. The procure-to-pay process introduced with Umoja has the potential to yield  discounts from vendors, such as prompt payment discounts with increased ability to  monitor the verification of goods and services, the certification of invoices and the  status of payments, in those cases in which the Organization has negotiated such  clauses with the vendors. However, the realization of such benefits will depend on  diligence in  receipt  and  inspection,  certification,  invoice-processing  and  disbursements on the part of the staff members responsible for those processes. In  addition, better contract management through the consolidation of some 3,200  systems and local contracts has the potential to prevent duplicative procurement.    A/71/729      16-22682  20/23      4.  Technology and data management    81. An important change introduced by Umoja is related to the retirement of  several legacy systems. In addition to savings in terms of hardware, software and  related human resources, the ensuing simplification of the information technology  systems and support landscape is facilitating the implementation of the information  and communications technology strategy. As additional business intelligence  capabilities are implemented, more benefits are anticipated as a result of better  aggregation of data and a reduction in the number of reporting databases.      5.  Global guidelines for the management of construction projects    82. In its resolution 69/262, the General Assembly requested the Secretary- General to ensure that best practices and lessons learned from the strategic capital  review were disseminated among duty stations. In response to that mandate, and to  ensure a consistent approach to all construction projects in the Secretariat, the  Department of Management developed global guidelines for the management of  construction projects. The guidelines highlight the roles and responsibilities of  various actors in successive phases of the construction process, with emphasis on  control mechanisms for projects, especially in terms of risk management and the  establishment and use of project contingency funds, among other matters.        V. Recommendations to the General Assembly      83. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the progress made by  the Secretariat in strengthening its accountability system, as described in the  present report.  84. The General Assembly is also requested to consider changing the  frequency of these progress reports from annual to biennial in order to provide  the Secretariat with more time to implement measures on which it reports.

It provides an indication of the principles that will  guide current and future management reform efforts.     From consultations I have undertaken since assuming office, I have clearly  heard that we are affected by slow, unresponsive service delivery; fragmentation in  management structures; micro-management by the governing bodies; a trust deficit  with Member States and with staff; inadequate resourcing of and ineffective  implementation of mandates; and a lack of transparency and accountability.    I am suggesting a new management paradigm that will empower managers to  determine how best to use their resources to support programme delivery and  mandate implementation. This will also mean transferring greater responsibility to  managers and holding them accountable for the programme and financial  performance of their programmes. It will not be a blanket delegation, but based on a  careful consideration of the capacities of managers to receive greater delegation of  authority and their abilities to properly execute it.    I am also suggesting a transformation of the Organization, based on sound  management principles, which will make the United Nations more nimble, effective,  A/72/492      17-16730  2/28    transparent, accountable, efficient, pragmatic and decentralized to better support its  normative and operational activities and will implement my ambitious reform  agenda.    I am making three main reform proposals in this regard. First, I am proposing  measures to streamline and improve the planning and budgeting processes. Budgets  should support better decision-making and better reflect the link between resource  use and programme delivery. Second, I am delegating managerial authority to  programme managers and demanding greater accountability from them for mandate  delivery. Third, I am proposing changes to the management and support structures to  better support delivery of programmes and provide managers with quality assurance  and strategic policy guidance.    The overarching objectives are to decentralize by bringing decision-making  closer to the point of delivery; trusting and empowering managers; ensuring greater  accountability and transparency; reducing duplicative structures and overlapping  mandates; increasing support for the field and reforming the planning and budgetary  processes.              A/72/492    3/28  17-16730      I. Introduction      1.  After more than 70 years, the United Nations remains more relevant than ever  to its mission: to deliver on its promise to save succeeding generations from the  scourge of war, reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, establish conditions  under which justice and respect for the obligations under international law can be  maintained, and promote social progress and better standards of life in larger  freedom. Peace and security, human rights, international law and development  remain the cornerstones of that mission.   2.  Through the United Nations, Member States have achieved significant  progress in the areas of peace, sustainable development and human rights. Yet, the  Organization has increasingly struggled to meet the objectives enshrined in the  Charter of the United Nations. The hard-won gains of the United Nations and its  Member States are fragile and at serious risk, including from a shift away from  multilateralism, in confronting the challenges faced by the world today in areas such  as climate change, population growth and displacement, the deepening of inequality,  poverty, human rights violations, increasingly entrenched and regionalized conflict,  and the growing threat of terrorism and violent extremism. Through experience, we  have learned that the failure to adapt or act results in the devastating cost of human  suffering and the tragedy of lost opportunity for global development and social  progress. I remain convinced that effective multilateralism and collective action by  the 193 States Members of the United Nations remain the world's best hope.  3.  To keep its promise to the people of today's world, the Organization must  re-examine how it functions, recognizing that substantive reforms in areas such as  peace and security and development must be underpinned by improvements in the  administrative functioning of the Organization. The management framework,  structures and procedures must enable and support a renewed vitality and innovation  across the Secretariat and the United Nations system as a whole to fully support the  fulfilment of the promise of the United Nations. We must enable unified action that  extends and best utilizes comparative advantages across the United Nations to  mutually reinforce the nexus of the work of the Organization in peace and security,  sustainable development, the protection of human rights and the preservation of a  healthy planet, while continuing to provide a valuable forum for intergovernmental  debate. We must act now, in all of those areas, if we are to fulfil what was  envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and leave no one  behind.  4.  The challenges to realizing the aims set out in the Charter are not, however,  exclusively external to the Organization. The Secretariat's centralized and  cumbersome management structure and administrative framework are not  sufficiently responsive to the growing number and scope of the mandates of the  United Nations, in particular in the field. Reform resulting in a different paradigm  that emphasizes an integrated approach and expedited delivery in the field is  critical. At a time when the overwhelming majority of United Nations personnel  serve in the field -- more than 90 per cent of civilian and uniformed personnel,  including two thirds of all civilian staff -- and most of the Organization's financial  resources are devoted to requirements in the field, the management framework must  be recalibrated to enable and support action in the field, where and when it is  needed. My reform proposal is aimed at bringing decision-making closer to the  point of delivery, simplifying rules, policies and procedures and decentralizing  authority to enhance the effectiveness of efforts. This requires institutionalizing  greater transparency and accountability in all activities to better serve the  intergovernmental and governance processes at Headquarters. In my reform  A/72/492      17-16730  4/28    proposal, I also propose the granting of greater managerial discretion in the  management and deployment of resources.  5.  With these thoughts in mind, in April, I established an internal review team to  examine what needs to be changed to make the Organization more effective and  responsive to those it serves. Through consultations with Member States and staff  members, at all levels, including heads of departments, regional commissions,  offices away from Headquarters and peacekeeping and special political missions,  the review team identified the following six key challenges:     (a)  Slow and unresponsive service delivery;     (b)  Fragmentation in management structures;     (c)  A weak performance management culture;     (d)  Gaps in resourcing of mandates and ineffective management of resources  for the implementation of mandates;     (e)  Gaps in transparency and accountability;    (f)  A trust deficit between Member States and the Secretariat.   6.  In concrete terms, I intend to deliver changes in those areas, by developing  proposals in four key areas. First, the leadership of the Organization must be  strengthened and empowered. Responsibility, authority and accountability must be  aligned and roles and responsibilities clarified. The focus of oversight mechanisms  must shift away from ex ante control to ex post facto compliance, matched by  accountability for results. Second, the Organization must become more transparent,  able to much more visibly and meaningfully demonstrate a clearer link between  resources and results, and must strengthen its risk management frameworks. Third,  to enable effective and timely action, authorities must be delegated, responsibly and  under clear conditions, so that they can be exercised closer to the point of delivery.  Fourth, the management structures at Headquarters must be reorganized to ensure  the accountable exercise of delegated authorities in support of effective and full  mandate delivery, including through the elimination of duplicative functions, the  establishment of a clearer division of roles and responsibilities and segregation of  duties, and the assurance of appropriate checks and balances.  7.  My vision for addressing the six key challenges rests upon two sets of  commitments into which I intend to enter, one with senior managers and one with  Member States. To senior managers, I pledge to give the full authority to deliver on  their mandates, as long as they do so transparently, responsibly and accountably.  From senior managers, I seek greater commitment to delivering reforms on the  ground and challenging the old ways of working. To Member States, I pledge that  the Secretariat will be transparent, responsible and accountable in its stewardship of  the resources of the Organization and in delivering upon agreed mandates and  benchmarks to ensure the implementation of all mandates. From Member States,  I seek their trust in the management of the Organization, allowing me the possibility  to take decisions that enhance the effectiveness of mandate implementation, within  the broad parameters outlined in the present report, without having to seek prior  approval for my actions.  8.  In addition, I propose the following major changes in the management of the  Organization:    (a)  Simplify and streamline the planning and budget cycle and reports,  including by moving from a biennial to an annual budget and shortening the  planning and budgetary cycle from five to three years. Programme planning and  performance information would be presented alongside financial information to    A/72/492    5/28  17-16730    improve the transparency of activities and support strategic decision-making.  I propose that Member States provide additional authority to redeploy resources  within the budget parts, not between them, thereby preserving the principle that  resources allocated for development should be used for development and those  allocated for the other pillars of the Organization should be used for those pillars.  I also propose that the scope of the commitment authority for ""unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses"" be broadened to respond rapidly to unforeseen events in the  areas of development and human rights;     (b)  Implement measures to increase the transparency of reporting to Member  States, including in monitoring, evaluation, programme and financial performance  and resource use;     (c)  Bring about an organizational change to eliminate duplicative internal  controls by establishing a Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance with a clear policy, strategy and compliance role and a Department of  Operational Support focused on operations, services, transactions and surge support  to entities in weak environments;     (d)  Take full advantage of Umoja and the global service delivery model to  carry out administrative transactions in a reduced number of locations. The United  Nations currently maintains functions, such as procurement and payment systems,  staff contracting, engineering and logistics management, in multiple locations.  I propose the consolidation of those functions into two or three centres and  undertaking a strategic assessment of the locations. This will be a complex exercise,  but it is urgently needed to ensure more cost-effective and consistent administrative  support. Improving supply chain management and enabling greater technological  innovations would also be critical;    (e)  Streamline and simplify human resources rules, processes and procedures  to ensure timely recruitment, deployment and staff development, with clear  delegation of authority to managers, together with clear rules of accountability.   9.  Throughout the process of reform, I will provide briefings to and consult with  staff as I firmly believe that staff are the most valuable asset of the Organization.  They deserve praise and support for their dedication and, in particular, their  personal sacrifices in the line of duty to the Organization, on the front lines of  conflict, in delivering humanitarian aid, protecting human rights, eradicating  poverty and leading the way along the path of sustainable development. I have met  with the representatives of staff, as well as staff at large around the world through  town hall meetings, and I intend to consult further as we move forward on the  detailed aspects of the implementation of management reform, in particular where  there may be an effect on staff welfare and conditions of service.  10. The management reforms set out herein are intended to strengthen delivery:  delivery at Headquarters, in support of multilateral deliberation and action and  setting and coordinating policy and strategic planning; delivery at the regional level,  in direct support of Governments, United Nations operations and other  intergovernmental and regional organizations; and delivery at the local level, where  our action most directly impacts the people we serve. The reforms take into account  the measures under way across the United Nations system to achieve more coherent  action with greater impact and build on the experience of past and ongoing  management reforms, taking advantage of previous investments made to strengthen  the Secretariat and enable unity of purpose and action in bringing fully to bear the  capacities of the Secretariat and, as appropriate, of the United Nations system. The  ultimate objective of the reforms is to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization  in meeting all its mandates and to enhance its accountability for results, while  complying with the parameters set out by Member States.  A/72/492      17-16730  6/28    11.  In this report, I set out in broad terms the concepts, purposes and principles  underpinning my reforms to the administrative functioning of the Organization, seek  the support of Member States in my vision for management reform, and identify  those areas where further work is necessary before detailed, costed proposals are  ready for submission to the General Assembly for its consideration. The  management reforms will be the principal enabler for efficient and effective  servicing of global operations, whether it be in development, peace and security, or  humanitarian response. They will cover the field, Headquarters, regional  commissions and offices away from Headquarters and will thereby allow the  Secretariat to address the needs of all areas, in particular the field, eliminate  duplication and enhance accountability through operational transformation and  appropriate delegation of authority. These reforms underpin the reform proposals in  development and peace and security.        II. Survey of previous and ongoing management   reform initiatives      12. Many attempts have been made over the years to address the challenges faced  by the Secretariat, to the extent that staff and Member States alike can be excused of  suffering from reform fatigue. Like my predecessors, I came into office recognizing  the need to build on and adjust prior reform initiatives to improve the administrative  functioning of the Organization. Modern management approaches have been  introduced with the development and/or implementation of the International Public  Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), the enterprise resource planning system,  Umoja, and the proposal for a new global service delivery model. They have also  included, most notably, the establishment of the Ethics Office, the Independent  Audit Advisory Committee, the enterprise risk management and internal control  framework methodology, the Secretariat-wide anti-fraud risk assessment, a new  information and communications technology strategy for the Secretariat, the  Department of Field Support and a series of human resources reforms, including  initiatives to promote managed mobility at different levels.   13. Yet, for all of the improvements achieved, much more remains to be done if  the Secretariat is to more effectively deliver on all its mandates. The Secretariat is a  complex organ that answers to many different intergovernmental bodies and pursues  many different goals and objectives. Over time, this has driven the staff of the  Secretariat to operate within silos, leading to conflicting or redundant activities and  an increasingly centralized, bureaucratic and risk-averse culture and leadership.  Administrative processes have become duplicative and slow to respond to the needs  of an Organization operating in increasingly dynamic, volatile and often dangerous  field-based environments.         Culture and leadership    14. If the United Nations is to truly lead, it must work across organizational  boundaries, harnessing the full power of its available resources, capacities and  partnerships. Critical to its success will be a profound transformation of culture, and  visionary and principled United Nations leadership -- at all levels and across the  system.   15. The United Nations must move to a culture that is focused more on results  than on processes, better manages administrative and mandate delivery risks, values  innovation, and demonstrates a higher tolerance for honest mistakes and a greater  readiness to take prompt corrective action. We must re-establish trust at all levels  and create a culture of empowerment and accountability, ensuring that leaders,    A/72/492    7/28  17-16730    managers and staff have the wherewithal to achieve, where, when and how needed,  and that the Organization is equipped and ready to support Member States as they  conduct their own work and take collective action. We must value and count on the  integrity and hard work of our staff, communicate openly what is expected of them,  recognize their performance against clear and fair standards, and ensure that staff  skills and competencies keep pace with the exponential rate of technological  innovation.   16. The reports entitled ""Investing in the United Nations: for a stronger  Organization worldwide"" (A/60/692 and Corr.1 and 2) and ""Investing in people""  (A/61/255 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1) identified the need to better support and  develop the United Nations leadership and management culture. Some steps taken  towards that goal include the introduction of compacts between the Secretary- General and senior managers as a strategic management tool, dedicating capacity  within the Department of Field Support on senior appointments in field missions  and the development of induction and mentoring programmes, and mandatory  training programmes for senior leadership.   17. United in purpose, the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for  Coordination (CEB) endorsed the United Nations system leadership framework in  April 2017. The framework sets out eight defining characteristics determined to be  essential to fulfilling the Organization's core mandate to promote peace and  security, protect human rights, address humanitarian needs and advance the  imperatives of economic and social progress set out in the 2030 Agenda. The eight  principles defining United Nations leadership are that it is: (a) principled, defending  the Organization's values, norms and standards; (b) norm-based, grounded in  United Nations values and standards; (c) inclusive; (d) accountable, demonstrating  360-degree accountability within the United Nations, across the United Nations  system, to  Member  States and  to those  served by  the  Organization;  (e) multidimensional, integrating across organizational boundaries and functions;  (f) transformational, achieving positive change; (g) collaborative; and (h) self- applied, exhibiting the principles in all interactions. To these, I have added a ninth  characteristic: that it is pragmatic and action-oriented, taking principled and  practical action to deliver on mandates, balancing administrative and operational  risks and erring on the side of action to prevent and address human suffering.   18. I have instructed that the leadership framework be integrated into all  leadership and management staff selection decisions at all levels across the  Secretariat and that revitalized leadership orientation, training, mentoring and  coaching programmes be updated accordingly. In addition, I have decided that a  360-degree evaluation mechanism will be developed around the nine qualities and  that appropriate measurements will be included in the Secretary-General's senior  leadership compacts with heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and  missions. The Secretariat will conduct periodic staff surveys to monitor staff  perceptions of their leadership and managers, and I will introduce measures to  recognize excellent leaders and managers and to hold accountable those who fail to  uphold the principles and characteristics of United Nations leadership.   19. Leadership and management development programmes mandatory since 2009  for staff at the P-4 to D-2 levels and the competency-based framework for staff  selection introduced in 2010 will be adjusted to reflect the leadership framework  and will be more closely aligned with organizational expectations and performance  management. Performance management has become a significant management  challenge that impacts delivery and effectiveness. When confronted with  deficiencies in management, staff often believe that the only recourse available to  them is through the system of administration of justice. The desire to avoid the  internal justice system can lead managers to avoid formally documenting  A/72/492      17-16730  8/28    underperformance or to take administrative action against underperforming staff  members. Although such situations affect only a small fraction of the staff of the  Secretariat, the perception of impunity has a deleterious effect on the effectiveness  of the Organization as a whole and undermines the esprit de corps in the noble work  of the United Nations. Further steps to improve the performance management  system are also in progress, in the context of responding to the request made by the  General Assembly in its resolution 68/265, as set out below.        Simplifying human resources management    20. While success requires a fundamental shift in how the Organization is led and  how it conducts its work, it can be achieved only with full reliance on the dedication  and hard work of all staff at all levels. The diversity and complexity of the global  United Nations presence must be matched by a diverse, geographically balanced and  gender-balanced, international and multitalented workforce that is truly representative  of, and benefits, all the peoples we serve through a strong sense of duty and purpose  to uphold the values on which the United Nations was built and for which it stands.   21. Although originally designed with the fundamental purpose of ensuring the  fair treatment of staff and equal opportunities, inordinately complex human  resources policies and centralized processes not only contribute to delays in taking  action in identifying, deploying, administering and managing the Organization's  workforce, but, ironically, also serve to disperse and depersonalize decision-making  and thereby stymie transparency and dilute accountability in human resources  management decisions. The recruitment and separation of staff, in particular, are  pain points, characterized by ex ante controls and processes that do little to  contribute to the prompt and effective management of the workforce, but rather  place the Organization at risk of administrative litigation and failure to effectively  deliver mandates. While there clearly is a need to preserve the due process rights of  individual staff members, administrative processes have devolved to the point of  inertia, where, in practice, compliance with all procedural steps has come to matter  more than making the right decision and taking the correct action in the interests of  the Organization.   22. As organizational needs and culture shift, the Organization's workforce must  also shift to address the challenges of the present and those of the future. The  complexity and changing nature of global challenges demand streamlined and  simplified workforce planning and management, including performance management  and training, that ensure that the staff profile keeps pace with what the United  Nations is called upon to achieve at any given time and that the Secretariat is  managed with competence, integrity, efficiency, effectiveness in pragmatic action,  transparency and accountability. To serve and to serve well, the Organization must  capitalize on the diversity of its workforce and the direct experience gained through  geographical mobility, where functionally feasible.   23. Despite human resources reforms undertaken over the past decade, the  Organization is not as operational and effective as I would like it to be. It continues  to struggle with the challenge of getting the right people with the right skills at the  right place at the right time. As noted in a recent report on human resources  management reform (A/71/323), it takes 239 days on average to recruit staff in  non-field duty stations, a far cry from the 120-day target. This is too slow to allow  the Secretariat to respond rapidly to emerging needs. Furthermore, many human  resources processes are centralized, rigid and cumbersome, and policies are not  sufficiently adapted to the field and not always consistently applied. A fundamental  shift in mindset is required. The strategic human resources function in the  Secretariat must work to define a common vision for the Organization and align its  policies and frameworks with that common vision. It must focus on attracting,    A/72/492    9/28  17-16730    recruiting and retaining talent, including through measures to foster meaningful  career development and address staff health and well-being. Human resources  management must also more effectively address planning and reshaping of the  workforce. In short, the human resources function must ensure that the Organization  is able to retain and nurture staff with the skillsets and dynamism to meet new and  emerging challenges.   24. Meeting the principles set forth in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter  must take concrete form not only by giving voice to the precepts that guide our  human resources policies, but also through a successful organizational renewal.  Human resources management policies must proactively contribute to greater  geographical and regional diversity of the workforce. It is unacceptable that, more  than two decades after the General Assembly, in its resolution 49/167 of  24 December 1994, urged the Secretary-General to implement fully the strategic  plan of action for the improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat (1995- 2000), the achievement of the goal of overall gender parity still remains elusive in  the Secretariat. I have stressed the importance of gender parity at all levels and have  instructed all senior officials to place it at the centre of their human resources  management priorities. In my senior appointments, I am committed to achieving  gender parity at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General levels  during my tenure and to ensuring greater geographical diversity among my senior  management team.   25. At the same time, there is a need to unite staff behind a common purpose and  to remember that every job at the United Nations, regardless of its place in the  hierarchy, is a unique chance for an individual to contribute to the wellness of  humankind. The Organization must re-energize the passion to serve the world.   26. In order to effect this transformation, the Organization must simplify its policy  framework and procedures and decentralize authority as close as possible to the  point of delivery, enabled by transparent and timely business intelligence reporting,  monitoring and quality assurance and measures for strengthened accountability.   27. The following issues need urgent attention and will be addressed in 2018,  taking into account the appropriate staff management consultations:    (a)  Review and simplify human resources policies and procedures, taking  into account best practices across the United Nations system and in other public and  private sector entities;    (b)  Improve workforce planning, paying specific attention to the profile of  leaders, managers and staff, to ensure quick and effective deployment as emerging  situations demand;     (c)  Strengthen measures to promote equitable geographical distribution and  gender parity;    (d)  Standardize and expedite job design and classification;     (e)  Improve the recruitment function and develop a human resources  dashboard to track key indicators, including on gender parity and geographical  distribution;     (f)  Take measures to speed up the screening of candidates, the verification  of their qualifications and job references and their onboarding;     (g)  Review the Secretariat's staff development policies, including mandatory  training, against the needs of the Organization, including consideration of industry  best practices regarding certification and recertification in certain fields;  A/72/492      17-16730  10/28      (h)  Refresh and align existing rosters and the Young Professionals  Programme across the United Nations system to facilitate inter-agency mobility  based on reciprocal agreements;     (i)  Produce an inventory of the skills of serving staff to enable their quick  deployment in the event of emergencies and reprofiling when needed;     (j)  Transform performance management, including introducing a 360-degree  evaluation mechanism, beginning at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant  Secretary-General levels;    (k)  Issue a downsizing policy;     (l)  Strengthen transparency and accountability mechanisms for the exercise  of delegated human resources management authority against established key  performance indicators.   Progress in all of these areas will be reported to the General Assembly at its  seventy-third session as part of a comprehensive human resources management  strategy.   28. Greater emphasis must be placed on investing in staff training and  development as part of a performance management system that will achieve the  required workforce shift in order to more effectively respond to present and future  requirements. Performance must be more effectively managed, including through  clear communication of expectations with staff members and measurement of  achievement against objective standards and updated competencies that are linked  to job design and standards across the Secretariat in order to align with the United  Nations system leadership framework endorsed by CEB.   29. Given the significant implications of the managed mobility framework on  those various streams and the need to explore alternative ways to incentivize  mobility, I am pausing the managed mobility programme so that the Organization  can benefit from lessons learned and prepare the comprehensive review requested  by the General Assembly in its resolution 68/265, which will be submitted to the  Assembly at its seventy-third session.         Streamlining programme planning, budget and finance    30. The continued strengthening of planning, budgeting and financial management  is critical to enhancing the performance and responsiveness of the United Nations.  Repositioning the management of the Organization for better delivery demands a  planning and budget process that is transparent and agile, accountable and  responsive, supportive of Member State action and decision-making and conducive  to pragmatic and effective Secretariat action.   31. The United Nations has demonstrated its ability over the past 70 years to adapt  to changes in the scope and breadth of mandates. The General Assembly has taken  action to adapt planning and budgeting tools in response to those changes. Plans and  budgets are governed by a tight regulatory framework, which includes extensive  reporting requirements, while oversight is exercised by the Committee for  Programme and Coordination and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions, as well as the Board of Auditors. Plans and budgets must now  be geared towards results. The Organization's accounting system and the related  financial reporting standards have been brought into line with international best  practices through the implementation of IPSAS, thereby improving the link between  financial and programmatic accountability. The new enterprise resource management  system, Umoja, now offers the Organization the potential to decentralize, modernize    A/72/492    11/28  17-16730    and streamline processes, improve reporting and increase transparency in the use of  resources.  32. Nevertheless, enhancements to the existing planning and budgeting processes  are needed. The current cycle is protracted, with plans and budgets formulated well  in advance of the period to which they relate. Related documentation is voluminous,  labour-intensive and too fragmented to allow for a strategic, overarching assessment  of the Organization's programme of work. Furthermore, the process does not allow  for the reallocation of resources to respond to urgent requirements arising during  budget implementation. In addition, specific mechanisms need to be updated or  expanded to keep pace with current operational needs.  33. Planning and budgeting need to be instruments in the service of the  Organization's priorities and its programme of work. Accordingly, improved  programme plans must enable coordinated action to address challenges to peace and  security and the protection of human rights, respond quickly to humanitarian  imperatives and ensure that no one is left behind in achieving the Sustainable  Development Goals. The budget document must also become an instrument for  supporting the delegation of authority to managers to ensure greater ownership and  responsibility for programme planning and delivery. The results of programme  evaluations, self-evaluations and lessons learned would be reflected more clearly in  the new annual budget format to increase transparency in programme delivery.   34. The budget process must ensure that the resources entrusted to the Secretariat  are best allocated for the effective and efficient delivery of all mandates. Our new  technology tools must be used to increase transparency within the Secretariat and  towards Member States. For example, future extensions of Umoja should enable the  Secretariat to use dashboards to report on the utilization of resources and visualize  programme information.   35. While Member States have granted some managerial discretion to many heads  of specialized agencies, funds and programmes, the Secretary-General does not  currently have the managerial discretion to shift resources between programmes  during the course of budget implementation without the prior approval of Member  States. An experimental limited discretionary authority authorized by the General  Assembly in 2006 had a number of restrictive conditions that constrained the use of  that authority to effectively addressing emerging needs (see resolution 60/283).   36. I would propose a number of measures to improve my ability, as chief  administrative officer of the Organization, to manage the activities of the Secretariat  in support of the mandates set by Member States. In order to make the Organization  more responsive to the demands of a fast-changing world and in the interest of  making the best use of existing resources, I will propose a more simplified and  transparent mechanism to redeploy resources within the budget period. The new  managerial discretion would enable a more strategic use of approved resources  during the course of budget implementation. The resources allocated to the  Secretariat would be used more collaboratively within pillars to ensure the effective  implementation of programmes and mandates within those pillars. This would  support my efforts to reduce the silos and improve communication between  departments and pillars and ensure that departments work more collaboratively in a  common pursuit of the Organization's mandates.    37. These changes to the planning and budgetary process are crucial to my efforts  to reform the structures and change the management style of the Secretariat. They  embody my commitment to managers by increasing their ability to manage their  programmes and resources, while holding them accountable for the delivery of  results. Senior managers would be able to show more clearly the extent to which  they are able to implement their programmes with the resources allocated to them.  A/72/492      17-16730  12/28    The changes to the format of the budget report would enable Member States to  assess past performance, the lessons learned from improved evaluation and how  they were applied to subsequent programme planning and resource requests. It  would allow for a more focused and strategic dialogue with Member States on  programme delivery and resource allocation.  38. Specific enhancements to the planning and budgeting processes are  summarized in the table below, with further detail contained in the addendum to the  present report (A/72/492/Add.1). The General Assembly's prompt action at its  current session is sought on the proposals contained therein.        Summary of the Secretary-General's programme planning, budget and finance proposals    Current  Proposed      Planning and budgeting process      * Biennial programme budget    * Integrated annual programme budget    * Plan outline is part I of the strategic  framework prepared every two years    * Stand-alone plan outline report to cover a  period of 5 years  Changes to documentation and the presentation of results frameworks    * Programme performance report, budget  outline, biennial programme plan  (31 reports), proposed programme budget  (47 reports), special political mission  reports (10-16 reports), first and second  performance reports, report on transfers  between sections and financial statements    * Integrated annual programme budget  (44 reports) and financial statements     * Biennial programme plan    * Revisions to the results framework along  with a streamlined presentation and focus  on performance reporting    * Financial resources presented at  subprogramme level    * Aggregation of financial resources    * Special political mission budgets prepared  and submitted in September-October during  the main part of the session of the General  Assembly    * Integration of special political mission  budgets into the integrated annual  programme budget (create separate section  for special political missions that will be  included in the budget proposal prepared  and submitted in April)    * 14 budget parts and 36 sections structure    * 7 budget parts and 34 sections structure    * Statement V of the financial statements  contains high-level information on budget  variance by budget part    * Enhance statement V of the financial  statements with additional information on  the financial performance of the prior  budget period, including variance analyses,  information on redeployments undertaken  within the budget part and information on  the use of funds under ""unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses"" during the period     A/72/492    13/28  17-16730    Current  Proposed      Exceptional funding and operational arrangements    * Limited budgetary discretion     * Managerial discretion to redeploy resources  within budget parts    * Unforeseen and extraordinary expenses  under authority of the Secretary-General  only related to peace and security and the  safety and security of staff and premises    * Broadening of the mechanism for the  commitment of unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses     * Working Capital Fund level: $150 million    * Working Capital Fund level: $350 million          Information and communications technology    39. Over the past few decades, as the United Nations capitalized upon the  increased availability of information and communications technology to improve  programme delivery, a highly fragmented and inefficient landscape emerged. The  establishment of a revised information and communications technology strategy  in 2014 (see A/69/517) allowed the Secretariat to better leverage information  and communications technology as a strategic enabler, overcome technology  fragmentation and protect the Organization against the increasing risk of cybersecurity  threats.  40. Offering a single enterprise resource planning system to replace the hundreds  of disparate platforms used across the Secretariat, Umoja implementation has the  potential to empower managers and Member States with relevant business  intelligence tools providing information in real time, including strategic  performance metrics that will support not only executive decision-making, but also  systematic monitoring, quality assurance and support, and transparent accountability  mechanisms.  41. I intend that the Secretariat will refocus on the implementation of the  information and communications technology strategy. To that end, the strategic,  policy, governance and oversight role of the Chief Information Technology Officer  will focus on the development of Secretariat-wide information and communications  technology governance, strategy, policy and standards and effective enterprise data  management to support executive decision-making, quality assurance and the  monitoring of support and accountability mechanisms.   42. The strategy will continue to adapt to the diversity of functions within the  Secretariat. In a decentralized Secretariat, flexibility and agility are essential in  order to adapt and respond adequately to the speed of technological change and the  diversity of the demands of Member States and civil society, including  multilingualism across the Organization. With that in mind, an operational  information and communications technology function will deliver tailored solutions  to organizational units and provide day-to-day technical support to end users,  working within the information and communications technology framework. Client  engagement at both the strategic and operational levels will ensure that solutions  enable the United Nations to more effectively and accountably deliver on its  programmes and mandates and manage its staff.  43. In the implementation of the information and communications technology  strategy, it is necessary for the Organization to ensure flexibility, opportunity and  security, recognizing the different ""business models"" of the various entities in the  Secretariat, and move away from the one-size-fits-all approach. The digital  A/72/492      17-16730  14/28    revolution imposes an accelerated pace and a need for continual replacement of  equipment and platforms and enhancements of applications. Staff who regularly  interact with political, social and economic actors require prompt access to software  solutions and interactive platforms to facilitate the meeting of their programme  needs and the delivery of their mandates. Government and civil society decision  makers, as they adapt to the variety of demands of the digital economy, expect quick  solutions.        Improving supply chain management     44. Procurement in the Secretariat today is an extremely large and complex global  operation in which contracts worth more than $3 billion are managed on an annual  basis. While much has been done in recent years to align the Organization's  procurement practices with public sector best practices and make it more responsive  to field requirements, I am committed to further developing the procurement  function within the United Nations to make it even quicker and more client- oriented.   45. Procurement in the Secretariat has been marked by fragmentation, duplication,  inefficiency and onerous bureaucratic processes and controls. As an illustration, an  area to be streamlined is the process of establishing systems contracts, which  currently takes approximately 24 months and includes 40 distinct steps, during  which action passes between the requisitioning office and the procurement office at  17 handover points. Moreover, delivery of goods and services through an  established systems contract can still take upwards of 288 days. The implementation  of global supply chain management provides an opportunity to transform the  requisition, procurement, inventory and contract management functions. While the  principles of ""best value for money"", fairness, integrity and transparency, effective  international competition and safeguarding the interests of the United Nations will  continue to govern procurement in the United Nations, the roles and responsibilities  and processes associated with procurement must be streamlined and internal  controls must be redesigned and realigned to better manage risk to allow for greater  agility and faster response times while maintaining segregation of duties.   46. Eliminating duplication and integrating procurement into supply chain  management, while safeguarding its financial and commercial independence from  the requisition function, would reduce the overall timeline and ensure that the global  portfolio of systems contracts remains responsive to changing requirements. I intend  to implement a more nimble and agile procurement process in which decision- making authority is brought closer to the point of delivery. The process would be  accompanied by streamlined procedures and strengthened oversight using business  intelligence available through Umoja and IPSAS that empowers executive decision- making, along with centralized monitoring and compliance ensured under a  strengthened accountability framework.   47. Special care will be taken to ensure that, before further delegations of  authority proceed, policies are clear, processes are streamlined, those receiving  procurement delegations of authority are fully trained and supported, and business  intelligence and monitoring are in place to enable informed and responsible  executive decisions under fully transparent accountability mechanisms. Moreover,  to ensure that the Organization continues to benefit from the most cost-effective  purchase of goods and services, a judicious balance will be effected between the  centralized procurement of global requirements and systems contracts and the  further decentralization of procurement authority to empower mandate delivery. It is  to be expected that the bulk of high-value procurement, constituting more than  80 per cent of current procurement, will be conducted through central operational    A/72/492    15/28  17-16730    support resources, while low-value procurement will benefit from quicker decision- making at the point of delivery.        Enhancing accountability and transparency    48. The United Nations has in place an individual and institutional accountability  framework to promote compliance, transparency and the effective stewardship of  resources in the delivery of mandates. This framework is summarized in the formal  definition of accountability established by the General Assembly in its resolution  64/259 and comprises a number of elements, including a body of regulations and  rules governing the activities of the Secretariat, as well as a number of structures  intended to address different aspects of accountability within the Organization.   49. Those structures include independent external entities, such as the Board of  Auditors, established by the General Assembly in 1946 to audit the accounts of the  United Nations and issue findings and recommendations to the General Assembly;  the Joint Inspection Unit, initially established in 1966 to examine cross-cutting  issues to enhance the efficiency of the functioning of the United Nations system;  and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, established in 2005 to assist the  Assembly in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, including supervising the results  of the work of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), and on risk  management and internal control issues.  50. The internal oversight structures include the Office of Internal Oversight  Services, established in 1994 as an operationally independent entity whose main  role is to enhance internal oversight through internal audit, inspection and  evaluation, and investigation services. The Ethics Office was established in 2005, to  ensure that all staff members observe and perform their functions in accordance  with the highest standards of integrity.   51. In 2014, the Organization adopted the International Public Sector Accounting  Standards for its financial statements, which allows for greater access to, and  transparency in, information in order to facilitate better decision-making. IPSAS  provides comprehensive information on the financial position and performance of  the Organization, which allows Member States to assign accountability. The  information generated by IPSAS also allows for a closer and more complete match  of costs with mandates, objectives and results, thus improving the link between  financial and programmatic accountability.   52. As a single global solution for the Secretariat, the new enterprise resource  planning system, Umoja, will offer visibility in real time to detailed data on all the  administrative operations which are supported by the system irrespective of where  they are being conducted in the world. As indicated in paragraphs 91 to 93, Umoja  will be a key enabler of management reform.   53. Recognizing the importance of a systematic approach to the high-level risks  the Organization faces owing to the complexities of its operations and the ever- growing scope of its mandates, in 2016, an enterprise risk management and internal  control framework methodology was promulgated, a Secretariat-wide risk  assessment was implemented, and corporate risk owners were designated. This  provided the Organization with a defined mechanism to identify the top strategic  risks and to put in place relevant risk response strategies for strengthened internal  controls. The full implementation of enterprise risk management in all departments  and offices at Headquarters and in the field will be essential for reforms, including  the implementation of the first-ever Secretariat-wide anti-fraud risk assessment, and  these efforts will be further facilitated through comprehensive training.   A/72/492      17-16730  16/28    54. Still there are gaps that weaken the implementation of the framework, and  areas where implementation may compromise the aims of the system despite the  best of intentions.   55. The first area I intend to address is the strengthening of the culture of  accountability within the Secretariat. I am keenly aware that our accountability  mechanisms cannot bear fruit unless the concept of accountability is embedded in  the manner in which staff and managers conduct their day-to-day activities. This  requires staff at all levels not only to be aware of the existing accountability  framework and mechanisms but also to understand their personal accountabilities,  responsibilities and authorities. I have therefore requested that global management  accountability guidance be developed that clarifies for staff how the accountability  mechanisms all fit together and are interlinked, and that contains the  accountabilities for all functional levels in each job network. In addition, I intend to  request the heads of all departments, missions and offices to develop specific  personal accountability frameworks for their internal use. In turn, the personal  accountabilities would be reflected in our recruitment and selection system and our  performance management system, including the Secretary-General's compacts with  senior management.   56. The senior management team is aware of the importance I place on modelling  the behaviour we wish to see throughout the Organization, including transparency in  decision-making, recognizing achievements and taking action on unsatisfactory  behaviour. I further believe that some key elements of managerial responsibility and  accountability at all levels are:    (a)  Delivering the vital mandates entrusted to programme managers by  Member States;    (b)  Monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies;    (c)  Managing any risks which could prevent delivery of mandates (supported  by the enterprise risk management system);    (d)  Using resources allocated to programmes in the most effective manner;     (e)  Proving that the right results have been delivered cost-effectively (through  results-based management);     (f)  Evaluating how projects and processes operate, to continually improve  how the Secretariat functions (evaluation and continuous improvement).  57. An important part of these efforts will also include strengthening the  implementation of results-based management, redirecting the efforts of staff at all  levels towards the achievement of the Organization's objectives and goals, and  shifting the focus of the Secretariat's efforts from inputs and activities to results and  outcomes. These results will inform decision-making through the whole planning,  programme budgeting and evaluation cycle, and will become an important element  of the accountability and reporting systems of the Organization.  58. Next, I intend to focus on the second pillar of accountability -- transparency  in the functioning of the Organization and accountability to Member States. There is  already a substantial level of openness in what the Organization is doing and how it  is performing, as evidenced by the reports submitted to the General Assembly on  mandate delivery and the stewardship of financial and human resources. However,  this is not enough and we need to do more. I am therefore proposing that the  Secretariat include programme performance information and the lessons learned in  the proposed programme budget document. Programme planning information will  be more clearly linked to the Charter, the Sustainable Development Goals and the  legislative mandates guiding the programme of work of each department and office    A/72/492    17/28  17-16730    during the course of budget implementation. Programme planning and resourcing  will be better aligned to the lessons learned from past performance, which will  increase the accountability of programme managers for results. Improved  presentation as to how funds are utilized increases the chance that they will be used  more effectively for positive results and desired outcomes.   59. I intend to publish, soon after the appropriate Umoja extensions are in place,  comprehensive, real-time and easily accessible transaction-level information about  United Nations operations relating to the Sustainable Development Goals, using the  standards established by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which  aims to make all information about spending easily accessible. This will allow  Member States and the public at large to access and assess information as they wish.  This, in due course, will lead to the revision of our reporting standards to enable  publication in the IATI Registry on a monthly basis, including all related financial  and procurement transactions, encompassing all our activities around the world.  Implementation will begin with the publishing of a data set of limited scope by  1 July 2018, with a view to fully meeting the IATI standards as soon as possible  thereafter.   60. I am committed to leveraging Umoja to develop an online portal that would  present expenditure information in a more interactive and accessible manner. The  online hub would use maps and infographics to provide easily comprehensible  information about United Nations operations, for the benefit of our partners, the  public and the international community. The data would be updated on a daily basis,  subject to legal, security and other practical considerations. Programme  performance information would be reflected on dashboards to provide greater  transparency during the course of budget implementation. Results of self-evaluation  and lessons learned would be published online. The implementation of the  recommendations of oversight bodies would be tracked and reported to the General  Assembly on an annual basis.   61. Third, I intend to strengthen the self-evaluation capacity of the Secretariat to  better inform programme planning and reporting on programme performance.  Results of self-evaluation and evaluation will be used by programme managers to  better plan and adjust their activities. Information on self-evaluation, including  lessons learned, will be reflected in the annual programme budget to increase  transparency on programme delivery to Member States. Self-evaluation will be both  a learning tool and a management tool. It should provide further quality assurance  on programme delivery and be central to providing greater accountability and  transparency to Member States. The quality of the current evaluation functions and  outputs varies markedly across programmes. To address those shortcomings, I have  directed the Secretariat to formulate a policy that will provide independent  assurance on programme delivery. The policy will be based on the United Nations  Evaluation Group norms and standards for evaluation, which set out overall  objectives and basic principles of evaluation. Secretariat programmes with  functioning evaluation units will be requested to develop new policies or adapt their  existing ones within the framework of the new policy. A roster of qualified internal  and external evaluation experts will be created. A small central evaluation capacity  will be established to provide support to smaller units that do not have a meaningful  performance tracking and self-evaluation capacity. This support will include  drafting terms of reference for self-evaluation, providing quality assurance,  managing evaluations and the roster, and providing skills development. Evaluations  will be made available to all Member States; I believe that Members will greatly  benefit from them and provide valuable suggestions for continuous performance  improvement. Changing the format of the budget report will allow Member States to  have a clearer sense of the link between resources and mandates. Results of  A/72/492      17-16730  18/28    evaluations, self-evaluations and lessons learned will be reflected more clearly in  the planning for future budgets.  62. The implementation of my strategy to combat sexual exploitation and abuse  and our strengthened whistleblower policy will be greatly enhanced by our ability to  conduct robust and timely investigations. OIOS is an important partner in those  efforts. I encourage Member States to mandate an external review of the mandate  and capacity of the Office, focusing on its functions in the areas of auditing,  investigation and evaluation.   63. The fourth component I have prioritized is risk management, to ensure that  hidden and underlying risks are brought to the fore and properly addressed. The  current system of internal control focuses on mitigating risks of an administrative  and financial nature -- waste, fraud and abuse -- and does so mainly through  reliance on ex ante controls, including numerous decision points and fragmentation  of authority. While those controls provide a measure of confidence in the  responsible stewardship of resources, the narrow focus on compliance creates  onerous bureaucratic processes and significant delays in programme implementation  which may at times be undue, considering the potential risks involved, and may  serve to blur lines of responsibility and challenge efforts to ensure real  accountability, thereby resulting, ironically, in a perceived lack of transparency and  a trust deficit between the Secretariat and the Member States.  64. Ultimately, accountability measures must allow the Organization to  demonstrate to the Member States results in the implementation of all its mandates.  The budgets provide a critical tool through which the Secretariat can be held  accountable to the Member States, but we must do more to ensure that the budgeting  framework not only measures the utilization of funds and other resources but  measures rather the effectiveness of actions supported by those contributions. Our  risk management framework must, in other words, take into account factors such as  the devastating cost of human suffering, the impact of delays or failures in mandate  delivery, the safety and security of the Organization's staff and the accompanying  reputational risks. We must realign our risk management approach to incorporate  those risks and balance them more adequately with administrative risks, so that we  empower our leaders and managers to act and deliver -- responsibly and  accountably. I will establish a system of performance tracking and an evaluation  mechanism to alert me to areas of underperformance, and to enable the Secretariat  to intervene earlier to mitigate any risks to successful delivery.  65. The introduction of an enhanced and more balanced risk management  framework and results-focused approach to resource management will more clearly  illustrate the operational and strategic risks created by onerous ex ante bureaucratic  processes intended to reduce administrative and financial risk. To be clear, the  recognition and mitigation of operational and strategic risks does not require or  imply any relaxation of compliance with the regulations or rules, and there will be  strict accountability frameworks to ensure that this does not happen. But, where the  Organization faces considerable operational and strategic risks, a shift from ex ante  control to ex post facto accountability and a higher tolerance of administrative risk,  coupled with enhanced transparency and improved reporting to Member States, are  required to ensure that the limited resources available are put to the most effective  use in delivering and meeting the expectations of all those we serve.        III. Aligning authority with responsibility      66. Although previous reforms have served to improve the administrative  functioning of the Organization, a piecemeal approach and a culture characterized    A/72/492    19/28  17-16730    by mistrust and risk aversion have led to a central administrative framework  designed to exert ex ante control over the use and management of human resources,  finance and procurement. While perhaps appropriate when the vast majority of  Secretariat resources were deployed at Headquarters, a globally dispersed  Secretariat with responsibility for a wide range of activities, ranging from the  registration of treaties to conference management to the conduct of complex field  and emergency operations, requires a more dynamic and responsive approach to  accountable resource management if we are to deliver results to Member States and  vulnerable populations in a manner that recognizes the reality that has developed  over the past seven decades.   67. The Charter of the United Nations designates the Secretary-General as the  chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The Financial Regulations and  the Staff Regulations approved by the General Assembly outline the broad  principles and legislative directives under which the Secretary-General is to manage  the financial and human resources of the Organization. Under both sets of  regulations, the Secretary-General issues rules by which to implement the  regulations. In the context of the administrative framework of the United Nations,  ""authority"" refers to decision-making power in the management of financial and  human resources.   68. Under the Financial Rules and the Staff Rules, the Secretary-General delegates  the authority to administer the regulations and rules to the Under-Secretary-General  for Management, who may, in turn, further delegate authority to other officials.  Authority in such areas as human resources, procurement, property management and  finance is currently subdelegated to different officials for different situations via  different routes. In the regional commissions, for example, human resources  authority is delegated to the head of the human resources section (P-5), procurement  authority is delegated to the Chief of Administration (D-1) and financial authority is  delegated to the Chief of Programme Planning (D-1). Each receives the delegation  of authority in his or her personal capacity, bypassing the Executive Secretaries who  are normally advised by their subordinates about the policies directed by  Headquarters. Another example relates to peace operations, where, for example,  human resources management authority is delegated in full to the head of mission  through the Under-Secretary-General for Field Support. Procurement authority is  delegated to a director or chief of mission support through the Under-Secretary- General for Field Support, bypassing the head of mission. Financial authority is  delegated directly to the director or chief of mission support, bypassing both the  Under-Secretary-General for Field Support and the head of mission entirely.  69. In some cases the delegation of authority does not cover the full set of  authorities required for the execution of the function in question and/or authorities  are inconsistently delegated to different parts of the Secretariat, so that the back- and-forth required to manage resources is encumbered by heavy processes and  controls that serve to blur lines of accountability and delay action, and present  operational risks to mandate and programme delivery.  70. The current framework for delegation of authority results in two fundamental  managerial challenges for heads of departments, heads of regional commissions and  heads of missions. The first is complexity: delegations of authority are often issued  or rescinded through the sending of memorandums or faxes between departments or  missions, making it difficult for a manager to easily understand the extent of the  authorities available to him or her. The second is that authorities and responsibilities  are separated: while heads of department and heads of mission are responsible for  implementing programmes and mandates, they frequently lack the authority to  acquire and manage the financial, human and material resources to do so. Where  responsibilities have been transferred from one department to another, delegation of  A/72/492      17-16730  20/28    authority has not been accompanied by the resources required to exercise that  authority, or systems are lacking to ensure sufficient training, support, quality  assurance, performance tracking and evaluation. In other cases, particularly during  mission start-up, the staff required to exercise delegated authorities may not yet be  available.  71. Concerns with the functioning of the system of delegation of authority are not  new and have previously been recognized by the General Assembly in its  resolutions, such as resolutions 53/221 of 7 April 1999, 64/259 of 29 March 2010  and 71/314 of 19 July 2017. The incremental measures taken in the past to address  them have largely been ineffective, however, as reflected in an audit by OIOS of the  management of delegation of authority, 1 reports of the Board of Auditors 2 and  reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the delegation of authority.3,4  72. Addressing this longstanding issue requires, as a first step, review and  simplification of the existing regulatory framework. I have, therefore, requested a  comprehensive review to remove unclear, obsolete and duplicate policies and create  new, clear and simplified policies and administrative guidance over the coming year.  The result of this exercise will be the creation of an easily searchable policy  compendium, the mapping of delegations of authority and how they flow, and the  forming of a baseline of simplified processes and procedures that will allow all staff  and managers the ability to easily identify and understand an existing policy or  administrative issuance. The easier the administrative framework is to understand,  the more accountably and effectively it can be executed at all levels within the  Secretariat.   73. As a second step, I intend to address the fragmentation of delegation of  authority and the misalignment between authorities and responsibilities for  programme and mandate delivery. The current arrangement, where authorities are  fragmented and processes involve multiple points of handover between departments,  is neither transparent nor accountable. The most straightforward way to introduce  clarity in roles and responsibilities, segregate duties, eliminate unnecessarily  complex processes and strengthen accountability is to delegate authorities directly  to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and missions, allowing  decisions concerning human, financial and physical resource management to be  made closer to the point of delivery. In areas such as human resources, I intend to  facilitate decentralized decision-making through delegating additional authority,  where it makes sense and where it is viable to do so, to programme managers,  including heads of departments, offices and missions. This will go hand in hand  with a robust accountability framework and proper guidance and support, so as to  allow for timely and responsible decisions by managers.   74. This approach ensures that the individuals who are accountable for the  implementation of programmes and mandates are actually empowered to effectively  deliver on those programmes and mandates, and that they can be clearly held to  account for how executive decisions are made against clearly set policies, standards,  values and benchmarks that will be transparently measured, monitored and  supported using reliable business intelligence provided in real time. This exercise of  delegated authority is not unconditional. In situations where the delegated authority  is not effectively or appropriately utilized or where it cannot be exercised, as in the  case of a small office or during the early stages of deployment of a new field  __________________    1  AH2007/510/01.    2  See A/70/322 and Corr.1 and 2.    3  See A/55/857 (JIU/REP/2000/6).    4  See A/59/631 (JIU/REP/2004/7).    A/72/492    21/28  17-16730    operation, the authority will be delegated elsewhere and exercised on behalf of the  entity.  75. It is my firm intent that the Secretariat will complete these two steps over the  course of 2018, during which time a judicious roll-out of increased delegation of  authority in human, financial and material resource acquisition and management  directly to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and missions will be  effected, once I am assured that the requisite safeguards and accountability  mechanisms are in place.  76. Together, these two measures -- simplification and decentralization -- will  make delivery of programmes and mandates more effective and timely. Steps  towards this increased delegation of authority must be matched with increased  transparency and accountability, if we are to meet the crucial need to fulfil our  fiduciary responsibilities and build trust with stakeholders. Umoja will play a  critical role in ensuring visibility of data and needs to be fully implemented at all  levels using business intelligence provided in real time, and the Secretariat  accountability framework will be strengthened through clarity of roles and  responsibilities and the segregation of duties.        IV. Changing structures and organizational design for  strengthened accountability      77. The existing Secretariat structure is not effectively organized to allow for the  transparent and accountable exercise of greater delegated authorities. Two  departments -- the Department of Management and the Department of Field  Support -- are currently responsible for the bulk of the management of financial  and human resources within the Secretariat. However, the division of  responsibilities between the two departments is often unclear. Duplication of effort,  repetitive processes and dispersion of delegations of authority contribute to the  lengthy timelines required for critical business processes -- most noteworthy among  them, budget formulation and recruitment -- creating frustrations in both  departments, in missions and among Member States. Moreover, despite the  significant similarities in the administrative requirements of all Secretariat field  activities, for historical reasons the Department of Field Support supports only  peacekeeping missions, special political missions, and the African Union  peacekeeping operation, the African Union Mission in Somalia.   78.  To address these challenges, I am proposing a change in the organizational  design to reduce duplicative structures and overlapping mandates by separating policy  from operations and by establishing two different departments: one for policy and  compliance and the other to support operations. This will require the re-engineering of  the existing Departments of Management and Field Support. Both new departments  would support the whole of the Secretariat.  79. Existing organizational structures, delegations of authority and management  processes were examined against the following principles: unity of command and  purpose; clarity of roles and responsibilities; and empowered delegations of  authority that are rational, holistic and decentralized as far as possible within an  established risk framework, in which risk assessment is supported by analytics and  individual oversight data and the exercise of delegation of authority is supported,  monitored and designed so that form follows function. With these principles in  mind, I propose to replace the existing Department of Management and Department  of Field Support with two new departments, the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support, each  of which within its respective roles and responsibilities would support the entire  A/72/492      17-16730  22/28    Secretariat. While structural reform is not the objective, the elimination of  duplicative structures and the creation of two new departments, focused on policy  consistency and accountability and operational support effectiveness, respectively,  are necessary to ensure that enhanced delegation of authority to senior managers  translates into improved programme delivery, responsible stewardship of Member  State resources, and a more responsive and proactive United Nations.         Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance    80. The proposed Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  would assume, on behalf of the entire Secretariat, the policy guidance, strategy,  planning and independent quality assurance functions currently exercised by the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support. The new  Department would exercise these functions across the areas of budget and finance,  supply chain, human resources management and information and communications  technology. In the area of budget and finance, the Department would oversee  Secretariat-wide financial planning, budgeting and production of financial  statements. It would be responsible for the strategic and policy aspects of the supply  chain, including asset management and the procurement policies. In the area of  human resources management, the Department would be responsible for  organizational human resources management policy, and it would undertake  strategic workforce planning, organizational development, talent management and  staff development. With regard to information and communications technology, the  Department would be responsible for strategic functions, such as policy and  standards development, as well as oversight over the information and  communications technology architecture and application development.   81. The Department would include a dedicated compliance and risk management  function, and would leverage the global visibility of resources and administrative  processes afforded by Umoja to perform real-time monitoring, evaluations and  performance management of all finance, supply chain and procurement, information  and communications technology and human resources management activities across  the Secretariat. The Department would also be responsible for administrative law,  management evaluation and oversight of conduct and discipline for the entire  Secretariat, including a strengthened internal accountability function.   82. In addition, the Department would represent the Secretary-General on strategic  management and policy issues before intergovernmental governing bodies,  administrative advisory bodies and inter-agency coordination mechanisms. It would  monitor emerging management issues throughout the Secretariat and manage staff- management relations by ensuring the effective participation of staff in issues  relating to staff welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of life and  other human resources policies.   83. Further, I intend to establish a Management Client Board, which would be  chaired jointly by the Head of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Head of the Department of Operational Support, and would  include rotating representatives for each of the different types of entity across the  global Secretariat, such as departments and offices at Headquarters, offices away  from Headquarters and regional commissions, peace operations and field-based  offices of special advisers and envoys. The Board would serve as a feedback  mechanism between the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Department of Operational Support and their clients. Where an  operational requirement is identified, the Board would feed into the policy-making  processes, including the development of field-specific policies, if required, as is the  practice in many of the funds and programmes which use Secretariat regulations and  rules.     A/72/492    23/28  17-16730        Department of Operational Support    84. The proposed Department of Operational Support would become the primary  operational arm of the Secretariat, assuming the operational and transactional  functions currently performed by the Department of Management, the Department  of Field Support, offices away from Headquarters, the regional commissions, the  Global Service Centre and the Regional Service Centre. The new Department would  exercise those functions in three broad areas: operational support, transactional  services, and surge, transition and special activities, with particular emphasis on the  requirements of all United Nations field activities, including peace operations,  delivery of humanitarian assistance and human rights monitoring, reporting and  investigation. The new Department would be responsible for operational and  transactional functions for and support to staff at Headquarters, offices away from  Headquarters, the regional commissions and the field.   85. Operational support would provide advisory capacities to senior managers and  staff in the exercise of their delegated authorities and for individual service needs;  administer information and communications technology applications, in compliance  with centralized established governance and guidelines; oversee supply chain  management operations, including the procurement of all goods and services that  would benefit from consolidated global planning, procurement and delivery; and  provide dedicated support to uniformed capabilities deployed to peace operations.   86. Transactional services would perform location-independent and administrative  tasks in areas such as human resources, finance and payroll, and in time other  corporate services, where it makes sense to consolidate and specialize, and would  also provide information and communications technology support to all  organizational entities within the Secretariat. In line with the global service delivery  model, those activities would be delivered by service centres offering support  24 hours a day, seven days a week, to leverage economies of scale and ensure the  consistent application of policies and procedures in meeting the requirements of all  organizational units across the Secretariat.   87. Surge, transition and special activities would be undertaken by a dedicated  capacity that would provide support for mission start-up, surges and transitions,  including for crisis response and humanitarian activities. Phases within mission  lifecycles such as start-up and liquidation have particular requirements that are most  effectively met by specialist teams with experience dealing with such requirements.  This pillar would also exercise delegated authorities on behalf of clients that lack  the capacity, temporarily or otherwise, to accountably execute delegated authorities  as determined by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance,  for example in the case of newly established missions or small field offices. The  delegation of authority, where circumstances so arise, may have to be withdrawn  and the decision to do so would be taken by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance in consultation with the Department of Operational  Support.        Departments, offices, regional commissions and field missions    88. Under the proposed arrangement, heads of departments, offices, regional  commissions and field missions would directly receive delegated authority from the  Secretary-General for the management of financial, human and material resources.  They would continue to be fully empowered to formulate their budgets within  overall levels established by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance; to manage the funds appropriated by the General Assembly; to recruit  and manage their personnel; to ensure effective use of innovative technologies; and  A/72/492      17-16730  24/28    to procure required goods and services through established mechanisms and within  the appropriate guidance.   89. Senior managers would be supported in those functions through a ""business  partner"" function responsible for administrative advice and guidance; internal  compliance with the regulations and rules and organizational policies and  procedures; operational resource planning and management; and achievement of  benchmarks and goals specified in the accountability framework. The business  partner function would also serve as the interface between organizational units and  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support. By being accountable for both resource  management and programme delivery, senior managers would be able to more  clearly demonstrate the relationship between resources and results, and to reflect  this in performance reports and other reports submitted to governing bodies.         V. Aligning ongoing reform initiatives      90. My vision for management reform of the Secretariat coincides with and  enables the ongoing implementation of a number of reforms authorized by the  General Assembly, such as the implementation of Umoja and the development of a  new global service delivery model. In fact, Umoja is a prerequisite for the enhanced  authority I intend to delegate to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions  and missions. Moreover, the establishment of a dedicated Department of  Operational Support builds upon the principles previously outlined in reports to the  General Assembly at the time of the establishment of the Department of Field  Support, and on the global field support strategy and the proposed global service  delivery model.         Umoja    91. Umoja is paving the way for more responsive and improved client services  through the standardization and harmonization of business processes within a single,  globally deployed system. The real-time visibility of global information facilitated  by Umoja should allow for more informed and timely executive decision-making  driven by business intelligence tools and the opportunity to modernize the internal  control framework of the Secretariat by combining greater delegation and  decentralization with improved accountability through increased transparency.  Umoja has not only opened the door to more efficient service delivery models, but  also serves as the impetus for the review of the existing administrative structures  that hinder the efficient use of resources and the effective delivery of programmes  and mandates. Embedded in Umoja access are clear roles and responsibilities for the  execution of transactional functions, representing yet another opportunity to support  the segregation of duties and establish a chain of accountability, when supported by  further simplification of policies and processes.  92. Umoja is gradually acquiring greater maturity in all locations. The  Organization has demonstrated its ability to adapt to new ways of working. This will  be leveraged and, through significant process re-engineering, strong process and  business ownership and robust change management, I expect to deliver the desired  qualitative benefits. A major software upgrade will also address one of the primary  complaints of Umoja, its user experience, and allow it to be accessed through  mobile devices. The enhancement of tools for senior managers, including business  intelligence offered in modular dashboards, will provide senior managers with the  relevant real-time information they need to effectively manage resources. This  functionality can be extended to Member States to allow them to visualize how    A/72/492    25/28  17-16730    resources are utilized, complementing the analysis provided in the regular reports to  the General Assembly.  93. The ninth progress report on Umoja will be submitted to the General Assembly  for its consideration during the main part of its seventy-second session and will  provide an update on the progress made in the past year, including in the  improvements made to Umoja Foundation and Extension 1, the development and  deployment of Umoja Extension 2 and the changes to the International Civil Service  Commission compensation package.         Global service delivery model    94. The global service delivery model is a key enabler of my reform agenda. The  Organization's current administrative framework is based on an intricate web of  procedures, often reflecting the constraints of a pre-Umoja past. The fragmentation  of administrative functions has resulted in divergent processes, inconsistent service  delivery and uneven client satisfaction across the Secretariat. Under the current  arrangements, accountability is diluted and effective oversight is impeded. The  global service delivery model is intended to address those challenges. Umoja  standardized and automated business processes across the Secretariat. The global  service delivery model will consolidate fragmented administrative structures within  and across duty stations, with the goal of improving service delivery through  simplified administrative policies, procedures and workflows to increase  responsiveness to operational requirements. It will also provide consolidated  administrative support capacity under a single management structure to allow for  greater consistency and scalability in service delivery, economies of scale and a  reduction of the Organization's footprint in higher-cost and higher-risk duty  stations.   95. The global service delivery model enables a Secretariat organizational  architecture that allows for greater clarity of roles and responsibilities, creates  proper checks and balances and ensures accountability for meeting client needs.  This allows for the consolidation of location-independent administrative functions  in shared service centres which would report to the Department of Operational  Support. Overall management policy formation, as well as monitoring, compliance  and quality control, would be performed by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The separation of functions allows each of the two  new departments to focus on its respective area of responsibility, while ensuring that  both are mutually reinforcing and accountable components of the management  architecture for the entire Secretariat. The Management Client Board, co-chaired by  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support, would concurrently serve as the client board for  the global service delivery model and ensure that policy development reflects  operational needs.   96. The shared service centres of the global service delivery model would report  to the Department of Operational Support, and the heads of the individual service  centres would report to the official responsible for transactional support services. To  ensure that shared service centres remain responsive to the needs of clients across  the Secretariat, their performance will be measured against key performance  indicators agreed and regularly reviewed by the Management Client Board. A client  relationship management platform is also critical for managing the interaction  between a service centre and its clients, including for tracking, reporting and  addressing issues raised by end users. An existing client relationship management  software application previously implemented by the Secretariat will be adopted for  the global service delivery model and expanded, including through the  A/72/492      17-16730  26/28    establishment of a common catalogue of services to meet the requirements of the  Secretariat-wide move to shared services.  97.  Some revisions to the global service delivery model, as originally presented, are  required to align with the proposed management architecture. The 2016 report to the  General Assembly on the global service delivery model (A/71/417) outlined a two- phase implementation road map, with an initial consolidation of functions into six  duty stations in 2018-2019 followed by a global consolidation of functions to two  shared service centres. Instead of this two-phase approach, I propose accelerating the  implementation of the global service delivery model and moving directly to two or  three shared service centres on 1 January 2019 as part of the establishment of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of  Operational Support. This will allow the Organization to avoid unnecessary capital  and human resources investments related to the initial phase of consolidation. To  ensure a smooth transition, the business process re-engineering -- and the associated  adjustments required in administrative policies and in Umoja -- will be completed  and consultations held across the Secretariat in advance of the implementation date.   98. The incorporation of the global service delivery model into my management  reform programme ensures that it will be implemented in a manner that is fully  aligned with all other reform initiatives. Changes to the original proposal are  therefore necessary and, in line with General Assembly resolution 70/248, must be  approved by the General Assembly. A revised proposal for the global service  delivery model will therefore be presented early in 2018 in the context of the report  requested by the General Assembly in section XVII of its resolution 71/272, and  will include a detailed cost-benefit analysis as well as the proposed locations for the  shared service centres for endorsement by the General Assembly. The detailed  inventory of functional areas and processes performed across the Secretariat  requested by the General Assembly will be presented in the context of my next  report on management reform, to be submitted for consideration by the General  Assembly during the second part of its resumed seventy-second session, as part of  the information and analysis underpinning the proposed establishment of the two  new departments.         VI. The way forward      99. The present report presents my vision for addressing the fundamental issues  that undermine the ability of the Secretariat to meet the objectives set forth in the  Charter of the United Nations and the global challenges now before it. The measures  and proposals contained in this report are aimed at improving the effectiveness of  programme and mandate delivery and addressing the six key problems identified by  the internal review team. The proposed restructuring of the Secretariat to establish  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support would facilitate the simplification, delegation  and decentralization required to permit delivery to occur in a more accountable and  transparent manner. I intend to revert to the General Assembly during the second  part of its resumed seventy-second session with a detailed proposal for  implementing this new management architecture for the Secretariat and other  measures requiring the approval of the General Assembly.  100. Addressing shortcomings in management culture and leadership is essential  for the success of management reform. As an initial step, therefore, I intend to fully  implement the United Nations common system framework for principled leadership  and to introduce 360-degree reviews, starting with senior management, to  strengthen the link between leadership and performance management.     A/72/492    27/28  17-16730    101. In the area of human resources management, and with the benefit of the  appropriate staff-management consultations, I intend to identify measures to  simplify procedures and reduce recruitment timelines, achieve gender parity,  strengthen performance management and improve capacity development. I propose  to reintroduce probationary appointments to enable the Organization to more  responsively evaluate the effectiveness of newly recruited staff. I also propose to  pause the implementation of the managed mobility framework in the light of  experience to date in order to permit a full review of its centralized processes and  their cost-effectiveness in meeting its intended purpose. I will revert to the General  Assembly with the results of this evaluation during the main part of the seventy- third session. In the interim, I also intend to work with the heads of the agencies,  funds and programmes to streamline and standardize processes, such as job design,  classification and reference checking across the organizations participating in the  United Nations common system, in order to increase inter-agency mobility and to  allow staff to enhance their skills, experience and value to the Organization,  enabling the organizations of the United Nations system to better work to their  comparative advantage.  102. To allow for decentralization and empowered human, financial and physical  resource management for programme and mandate delivery, the Secretariat will  proceed with a comprehensive review of existing policies and procedures to clarify  and streamline them. The Secretariat will also carefully examine the capacity to  effectively put in place holistic delegations of authority, making certain that all  required steps are taken to ensure that the training, support, monitoring and  accountability mechanisms are in place to support their judicious and effective roll- out over the course of the coming months until the end of 2018.  103. The Secretariat must strengthen the linkage between resources and results. In  the future, budgets will be better linked to indicators such as progress towards the  achievement of the targets under the Sustainable Development Goals, increased  acceptance of international norms and standards by Governments, improvements in  indicators such as the human development index and reduction of conflict in areas  of peacekeeping deployment. The United Nations should work with its many  partners and make use of the rich data sets that have become available in recent  years to develop more meaningful ways to measure results. These can form the  cornerstone of a new approach to the presentation of the programme budget, one by  which the time between budget formulation and execution is reduced and the  presentation of the budgets is better aligned with the activities set forth in the  Charter and more clearly linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  104. The real-time visibility afforded by Umoja will be used to enhance oversight  of procurement and supply chain management. Procurement will be integrated, with  appropriate safeguards, into the global supply chain, which will focus on satisfying  client requirements at the right place, at the right time and at the right cost, while  also assiduously ensuring the segregation of duties. It will also reflect a balanced  approach that recognizes that certain requirements can be most effectively sourced  and delivered globally while other requirements are most appropriately sourced  locally, thereby providing flexible and optimized solutions for clients across the  Secretariat.  105. Finally, I intend to significantly strengthen accountability by aligning  authority with responsibility, and by ensuring that the Organization accounts for and  mitigates the full range of risks that affect its activities, including administrative,  financial, operational and strategic risks. Where appropriate, the Organization  should rely on ex post facto review, as opposed to ex ante control, of delegated  holistic executive decision-making authority for human, financial and material  resources in the delivery of programmes and mandates to ensure accountability.  A/72/492      17-16730  28/28    Underpinned by performance monitoring, quality assurance and proactive support  guided and aided by information technology platforms that allow for greater  transparency in the use and management of resources, management accountability  will be overseen by a dedicated performance monitoring, quality assurance and risk  management function in the new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.         VII. Change management      106. I fully appreciate that the transformational agenda outlined above will require  an exercise in change management perhaps as substantial as any that the  Organization has seen to date. To oversee the change, I have appointed the Chef de  Cabinet as the Project Sponsor on Change Management. The project will be led  jointly by the Under-Secretaries-General for Management and Field Support. The  Chef de Cabinet may appoint a project trustee to ensure full coordination in the  implementation of the management reform. The project will have a Governance  Board comprising an appropriate representation of department heads and business  owners. The project will be staffed by a dedicated team led by a project manager  and a group of team members on full-time release who will be selected from across  the Organization. External expert assistance on change management and project  management will be called upon selectively to ensure that the best practices are  being adopted in the process. The team will also work closely and engage regularly  with the change teams in other areas of reform.        VIII. Conclusion      107. The unprecedented challenges confronting the United Nations across the  spectrum of peace and security, humanitarian action and human rights protection  and sustainable development will not be met unless our Organization finds better  and stronger means of putting the full force of our capacities at the disposal of the  Member States, the international community, and the peoples we serve.  Management and administrative silos, antiquated and calcified business processes  and structures, and imbalanced risk management must be addressed if we are to lend  our full support to Member States and ensure our active engagement in preventing  and dealing with human suffering. In 2017, I have introduced a series of reform  initiatives designed to enable the Secretariat to deliver on the promises of the  Charter. Once more, I pledge my commitment and determination for the Secretariat  to do its part in their implementation.   108. The General Assembly is requested:    (a)  To take note of the report of the Secretary-General and endorse his  vision for management reform of the Secretariat;    (b)  To request the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly  at the second part of the resumed seventy-second session a comprehensive  report on the implementation of his management reform proposals;    (c)  To support the creation of the Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support, and to  request the Secretary-General, in the context of the above-mentioned  comprehensive report, to provide detailed information on the functions,  structure and staffing requirements of the new structure.

A strong regulatory  framework, governing all aspects of the programme planning and budgeting cycle,  has been put in place. In recent years, the Organization's accounting system and the  related financial reporting standards have been brought into line with international  best practices through the implementation of the International Public Sector  Accounting Standards. A new enterprise resource planning system, Umoja, now  offers the Organization the potential to decentralize, modernize and streamline  processes, improve reporting and increase transparency in the use of resources.    While previous reform efforts have generated some significant improvements,  there are still aspects of the programme planning and budgeting process that could be  improved further. The current cycle is protracted, and documentation is too  voluminous and fragmented to allow for a strategic assessment of the Organization's  programme of work. The Secretary-General lacks the managerial authority to shift  resources between programmes in support of delivering Organization-wide priorities.  The existing limits to the level of the Working Capital Fund and the authority granted  to the Secretary-General in committing funds for unforeseen and extraordinary  expenditures no longer reflect the current needs of the Organization.  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  2/99      To this end, the Secretary-General proposes the streamlining and improvement  of the planning and budgetary processes to better support decision-making and  increase the transparency of information. Specific proposals outlined in the present  report include: (a) moving from a biennial to an annual process; (b) shortening the  planning and budgetary cycle from five to three years; (c) presenting programme  planning and performance information in the annual regular budget instead of  separate reports; (d) refining elements of the results-based-budgeting framework;  (e) strengthening performance reporting by reflecting information on lessons learned,  including from evaluation and self-evaluation, in the annual budget; (f) seeking  greater authority for the redeployment of resources during budget implementation;  and (g) increasing the level of the Working Capital Fund.    The proposals contained in the present report would enable the Organization to  better respond to the new management paradigm shift envisaged by the Secretary- General (see A/72/492).            A/72/492/Add.1    3/99  17-16667      I. Introduction       1.  Making the United Nations more responsive to the demands of a fast-changing  world includes creating a planning and budgeting process that is transparent and  agile, a process that ensures that resources are best allocated for the effective and  efficient delivery of mandates. Planning and budgeting need to be strategic  instruments in the service of the Organization's mandates, priorities and programme  of work.  2.  The budget document must become an instrument for ensuring greater  ownership and accountability on the part of senior managers with respect to  programme planning and the delivery of mandates. Results of programme  evaluations, self-evaluations and lessons learned must be reflected more clearly in a  format that would increase transparency for delivery. The budget document must  support a more focused and strategic dialogue with Member States on programme  delivery and the allocation of resources.  3.  The planning and budgetary processes must ensure that the resources entrusted  to the Secretariat are best allocated for the effective and efficient delivery of all  mandates. Our new technology tools must be used to increase transparency within  the Secretariat and towards Member States. Our resources must be used in support  of mandates approved by Member States. The Secretary-General needs to be able to  redeploy resources within parts of the budget to support better implementation of  mandates.   4.  With regard to the regular budget, the Secretary-General proposes the  streamlining of planning and budgetary processes to better support decision-making  and increase the transparency of information. Specific proposals outlined in the  present report include: (a) moving from a biennial to an annual process; (b) shortening  the planning and budgetary cycle from five to three years; (c) presenting programme  planning and performance information in the annual regular budget instead of in  separate reports; (d) refining elements of the results-based-budgeting framework;  (e) strengthening performance reporting by reflecting information on lessons learned,  including from evaluation and self-evaluation, in the annual budget; (f) seeking  greater authority for the redeployment of resources during budget implementation;  and (g) increasing the level of the Working Capital Fund.         A. Background      5.  The basic principles of the Organization's budgetary process are set out in  Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations, which provides that the General  Assembly shall consider and approve the United Nations budget, and apportion the  expenses of the Organization among the States Members of the United Nations. As  chief administrative officer of the Organization, the Secretary-General is  responsible for preparing and submitting a budget proposal to cover the costs of the  activities of the United Nations Secretariat funded under the regular budget. The  Organization relies on Member States to provide adequate resources and to pay their  contributions on time and in full.   6.  Two committees, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, review the  planning and budgeting proposals formulated by the Secretary-General, in  accordance with their respective mandates, and submit their conclusions and  recommendations, through the Fifth Committee, to the General Assembly for  consideration and approval.  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  4/99    7.  The planning and budgetary process has evolved over the past 70 years. The  most significant developments are summarized in the paragraphs below.  8.  In 1974, the Organization adopted programme budgeting, whereby the budget  document reflects the programmatic activities of the United Nations Secretariat and  the related decisions of its governing bodies. Before 1974, the Organization had  used object-of-expenditure budgets. The new budget format was intended to allow  for analytical and integrated consideration of the cost, content and significance of  each programme. The budget period, which until that time had been prepared on an  annual basis, was changed to a biennial budget period (see General Assembly  resolutions 3043 (XXVII) and 3199 (XXVIII)). The Organization, for the first time,  also introduced the concept of a single planning document, the medium-term plan,  covering a four-year cycle.   9.  In its resolutions 41/213 and 42/211, the General Assembly introduced  additional features, including the establishment of a budget outline and a  contingency fund. The budget outline contains, inter alia, an indication of a  preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of  activities for the following biennium. The contingency fund, expressed as a  percentage of the overall budget outline level, accommodates additional  expenditures relating to the biennium derived from legislative mandates not  provided for in the programme budget or from revised estimates arising from the  impact of extraordinary expenses, subject to certain provisions.  10. In its resolution 55/231, following a review of the existing planning,  programming and budgeting process, the General Assembly adopted a new  methodology for budget preparation, namely, the use of results-based-budgeting  frameworks focusing on the outputs to be produced and consequent outcomes, as  opposed to input budgeting, which had been the primary methodology until that  time. In 2004, the four-year medium-term framework was replaced with a biennial  strategic framework, comprising a plan outline reflecting the longer-term objectives  of the Organization (part one) and a biennial programme plan (part two) (see  Assembly resolutions 58/269 and 59/275).   11.  All aspects of this process are governed by the Financial Regulations and  Rules of the United Nations and the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme  Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation  and the Methods of Evaluation, all of which have been periodically updated to  reflect the aforementioned changes. Most recently, they were amended to reflect the  adoption by the General Assembly of the International Public Sector Accounting  Standards (IPSAS) in 2013, and again in 2016, to incorporate relevant Assembly  resolutions on programme planning. At its seventy-second session, the Assembly  will consider revisions to those parts of the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programming Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation dealing with evaluation, namely,  chapter VII and the annex.   12. A comprehensive summary of the evolving legal framework governing the  process of planning and budgeting at the United Nations is contained in annex I to  the present report.        B. The current planning and budgeting process      13. Overall, the United Nations has shown itself capable of adapting to the  changes in the scope and breadth of mandates entrusted to it since its creation more  than 70 years ago. As a consequence, the planning and budgeting process and the  related tools and mechanisms have evolved in response to these changes.    A/72/492/Add.1    5/99  17-16667    Accordingly, the General Assembly has taken action to adapt the planning and  budgeting tools in support of the efficient and effective delivery of mandates.  14. The planning and budgeting process consists of the preparation, submission,  consideration and approval of the following four elements: (a) the strategic  framework (parts one and two); (b) the budget outline; (c) the programme budget;  and (d) the performance reports, both programme and financial, and the financial  statements. At each stage, the roles and responsibilities of the Secretary-General, the  Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee -- as the  committee of the General Assembly with responsibilities for administrative and  budgetary matters -- are made clear in the successive resolutions, rules and  regulations described in paragraphs 5 to 12 above. In addition, article VII and the  annex to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations set out the role  of the Board of Auditors with respect to the Organization's financial statements, its  internal controls and the application of IPSAS.  15. Consequently, the existing process of planning and budgeting is not lacking in  transparency or accountability. Every aspect of the process is fully documented and  codified. Programme plans are extensively articulated within the strategic  framework and the programme budget. Resource requirements, allocation and usage  are clearly reported.   16. Furthermore, the systems underlying these processes have recently been  updated and modernized. The United Nations is now entering its third year of  applying IPSAS and has received an unqualified audit opinion every year, which  reflects the soundness of its financial management practices and improved  accountability. Additional benefits of IPSAS include the requirement to report more  comprehensive financial information and analysis and the ability to generate more  extensive cost data.   17. The Organization is also in the process of implementing an enterprise resource  planning system, Umoja. While the budget formulation module has yet to be  implemented, the system has become the operational system for more than 32,000  staff at 400 locations worldwide. Financial information produced using Umoja,  including the financial statements themselves, is already yielding benefits in terms  of more comprehensive, up-to-date, transparent and timely information for decision- making. The information can be calibrated more flexibly and made readily  available, according to the needs of different users. In this regard, the vision of the  Organization is to make information on expenditure and programme delivery  available to Member States online through dashboards.   18. The Organization is now able to build on these transformations and move to  the changes proposed below.         C. The current system: areas for improvement      19. In seeking to further improve the management of the Secretariat, the  Secretary-General considers that additional enhancements to the current planning  and budgeting process are needed to address the following shortcomings.   20. First, the current planning and budgeting cycle takes in excess of five years,  from the initial preparation of the strategic framework until the final consideration  of the financial statements and the related performance reports. The protracted  nature of the process means that plans and budget proposals are formulated well in  advance of the period to which they relate, as a result of which they do not always  reflect the impact of new and emerging mandates that arise during budget  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  6/99    implementation. Similarly, the impact of newly emerging mandates on the biennial  programme plan are dealt with separately from the programme plans and budgets  for extended periods, until the following biennial period. For example, for the  biennium 2016-2017, the new focus on the Sustainable Development Goals, which  had been approved by Member States in 2015, a few months before the adoption of  the current programme budget, was not reflected in the published programme plan  and budget. The changes to the programmes resulting from the adoption of the  Goals could be reflected only in programme planning and budgeting reports for the  biennium 2018-2019. The preparations for the planning process are currently  disconnected from those for the budget process. The current process does not ensure  that decisions on resource allocation adequately reflect the lessons learned from past  programme performance. The Assembly receives the programme performance report  relating to the previous biennium only towards the end of the first year of  implementation of the subsequent two-year budget.   21. Second, the documentation submitted in support of this process is fragmented,  reflecting different stages and aspects of the current planning and budgeting  process. Currently, the Secretary-General submits nine separate main reports, some  of which consist of sets of reports, with respect to a single biennial budgetary cycle,  each with a different emphasis and level of detail. Taken together with the reports of  the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 300 separate reports are currently  considered by the General Assembly at different points in the overall cycle  pertaining to the plans and resources for a given biennium. In addition, the  documentation submitted for this process is voluminous and labour-intensive.1   22. Third, during budget implementation, the Secretary-General has no authority  to shift resources between programmes without the prior approval of Member  States. Such managerial authority has been granted by the Member States to many  heads of specialized agencies, funds and programmes in order to improve their  capacity to respond to fast-changing demands. An experimental limited  discretionary authority approved by the General Assembly in 2006 (see resolution  60/283) has a number of restrictive conditions that constrain the Secretary-General's  ability to use it to effectively address emerging needs.  23. Finally, the existing limits to the level of the Working Capital Fund and the  authority granted to the Secretary-General in committing funds for unforeseen and  extraordinary expenditures no longer reflect the current needs of the Organization if  it is to operate with an acceptable cash risk and if it is to respond effectively to  urgent emerging demands, not only for peace and security, but also in the other two  main pillars of the Organization.         II. Proposals      24. The Secretary-General does not propose a fundamental overhaul of the  existing intergovernmental review process of planning and budgeting. Instead, he  puts forward a number of technical enhancements to the existing process and  documentation for the purpose of ensuring greater transparency and accountability  and better responsiveness to the needs of Member States.   __________________    1  The programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017 contained 36 separate sections, which  translated into 153 budget reports (excluding statements of programme budget implications and  supplementary budget proposals), and totalled approximately 7,000 pages. An additional 7,900  pages of written responses were submitted, to 6,000 questions posed during the intergovernmental  review of the various budget reports relating to the biennium 2016-2017, indicating the need to  improve the timeliness and type of information provided to Member States.    A/72/492/Add.1    7/99  17-16667    25. The change proposals concern three main areas: (a) the planning and  budgeting process itself; (b) the documentation currently prepared during the course  of that process; and (c) the use of exceptional funding and operational  arrangements.        A. The planning and budgeting process      Figure I   Existing versus proposed cycle       Abbreviations: ACABQ, Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions; BO, budget outline; BoA, Board of  Auditors; BPP, biennial programme plan; CPC, Committee for Programme and Coordination; FS, financial statements;  PPB, proposed programme budget; PPR, programme performance report; Q, quarter; SPMs, special political missions;  TRA, report on transfers between sections; 1PR, first performance report; 2PR, second performance report; 5C, Fifth  Committee.      26. Figure I sets out the current planning and budgetary process, which, as  indicated above, spans more than a five-year period from beginning to end. The  Secretary-General proposes that the current biennial budget be replaced with an  ""integrated annual programme budget"" (referred to hereinafter as the ""annual  budget""), in order to allow for the preparation of more realistic and responsive  programme plans and resource estimates. Such a change would address a concern  expressed by the Board of Auditors regarding the basis for revised estimates and  budgetary adjustments within the existing biennial budget cycle (see A/72/176 and  Corr.1, para. 25).   27. Combined with changes to various documentation requirements and the  preparation of a new integrated budget document, which is explained below, the  adoption of an annual budget would permit the existing planning and budgeting  cycle to be shortened by two years. That would allow for more realistic programme  and financial information, formulated closer to the point of implementation. An  annual budget would also allow for the alignment of the budget period with the  current reporting period of the financial statements. It would not affect the issuance  by the Secretariat of assessment letters to Member States, which is currently done  early in January each year.  Existing cycle (biennium 2020-2021) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4     Planning cycle (2.25 years) Implementation cycle  (2 years) Performance  reporting (2 years) BPP  CPC   5C     SPM ACABQ 5C   SPM ACABQ 5C TRA ACABQ BO ACABQ 5C   ACABQ ACABQ PPR CPC 5C PPB ACABQ   5C 5C FS BoA ACABQ 5C Proposed cycle (year 2020) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4       Planning cycle (1.25 years) Implementation (1 year) Performance report (1 year)   ACABQ   BoA  CPC     ACABQ 5C 1PR 2PR 5C New integrated budget  document, including  SPMs 5C No  performance  reports FS A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  8/99    28. While the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions would continue to examine  the programmatic and financial aspects of budget documents and to submit their  conclusions and recommendations to the General Assembly for its consideration, in  accordance with their respective mandates, the two Committees would consider the  budget report at the same time in the annual cycle, thereby allowing for greater  focus and integration within the process. The Fifth Committee would be able to  consider both the programming aspects and the financial requirements of the budget  on the basis of the advice of the two Committees.   29. In addition, the current, two-year budget implementation process is susceptible  to resource fluctuations triggered by changes in rates of exchange and inflation,  requiring four separate recosting exercises under the existing methodology, each of  which can have a significant budgetary impact. As a result of its proposed  annualization, the budget would include an initial recosting element that would be  updated just once, immediately before the beginning of the budget period, allowing  greater certainty for the Member States in terms of their financial obligations. If  final budget expenditures should exceed the annual budget as a result of  overexpenditure under post resources, the Secretary-General, after taking into  consideration the final overall programme expenditures and savings from the  cancellation of prior-period obligations, would seek an additional appropriation, in  accordance with the staffing table as approved by the General Assembly and the  post-related actual expenditures.  30. The Secretary-General also proposes that the existing plan outline, which  forms part one of the strategic framework, be submitted every five instead of two  years. The plan outline would continue to reflect the longer-term objectives of the  Organization. It would continue to be presented as a separate document for  consideration by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the General  Assembly. The extended period would allow for the articulation of longer-term  objectives and strategy, policy orientation and overall trends in mandate evolution,  reflecting the priorities established by intergovernmental organs as well as  anticipated future challenges.         B. Changes to documentation and the presentation of  results frameworks      31. Several measures are required to enhance the focus and utility of the  documentation submitted to the intergovernmental bodies at various points in the  planning and budgeting process. In addition, the proposed annual budgeting cycle  would require changes in the content and nature of the reports submitted to the  intergovernmental and expert bodies so that, as explained below, the existing  workload of those bodies is not markedly affected by the need to review budgetary  reports every year.      1.  Consolidation of reports    32. The Secretary-General proposes the consolidation of nine existing reports or  sets of reports into two annual reports: the annual budget proposal and the financial  statements of the Organization, as illustrated in figure II. The plan outline,  containing the longer-term objectives of the Organization, would remain a separate  document, submitted through the Committee for Programme and Coordination to  the Fifth Committee.      A/72/492/Add.1    9/99  17-16667        Figure II  Integration of reports        33. The proposed annual budget report would incorporate information currently  reflected in the biennial programme plan, the budget outline, the proposed  programme budget, the budget proposals for special political missions and the  programme performance report. The inclusion of information on programme  performance and lessons learned from the previous period in the annual budget  would also improve accountability and allow for the timely adjustment of resource  requirements to enable better mandate delivery.   34. The Secretary-General considers that the shorter budget cycle would also  eliminate the need for separate reports for the budget outline, the first and second  financial performance reports and the biennial report detailing the transfer of  resources between budget sections. Information on programme performance would  be included in the annual budget, not in a separate report. The budget outline would  no longer be required, since the proposed annual budget would be prepared closer to  the implementation period. Consequently, there would be no need to establish a  preliminary basis for resource estimates in advance of the budget proposal, since the  General Assembly would be in a position to take decisions on the budget level more  frequently, on the basis of a more reliable and up-to-date proposal of resource  requirements. However, the information on the main factors resulting in resource  changes that would have an impact on the budget for the following year would be  provided as part of the foreword and introduction of the proposed new annual  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  10/99    budget proposal, as reflected in the prototype contained in annex II to the present  report. Information currently contained in the second financial performance report  would be incorporated into the financial statements, audited by the Board of  Auditors and reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions.  35. The General Assembly established a contingency fund mechanism as part of  the arrangements set out in resolutions 41/213 and 42/211. The mechanism  accommodates revised and supplementary programme budget requirements, in  particular those arising from legislative mandates approved in the year preceding  the biennium and during the biennium that are not provided for in the proposed  programme budget. The contingency fund is expressed as a percentage of the  programme budget outline level approved by the Assembly, and its use is confined  to the biennium to which it relates.   36. Given that the budget outline would not be presented as a separate document  (see para. 34 above), the Secretary-General proposes to submit an indication of the  size of the contingency fund as a percentage of the overall level of resources of the  proposed annual budget. For example, the contingency fund related to the annual  budget for 2021 would be proposed in the annual budget report for 2020 and would  be approved by the Fifth Committee at the time of the approval of the annual budget  for 2020. The level of the contingency fund related to the annual budget for 2021  would be expressed as a percentage of the approved annual budget for 2020. The  contingency fund related to the annual budget for 2020, as a one-time measure,  would be proposed and approved in the context of the first performance report for  the biennium 2018-2019 and expressed as a percentage of half of the approved  budget for 2018-2019 (or the equivalent of a one-year period). This would ensure  that the level of the contingency fund would continue to be determined in advance  of the budget period that it covers. Other provisions governing the use of the  contingency fund contained in resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 would remain  unchanged.       2.  Changes to the budget presentation    37. The Secretary-General proposes a number of enhancements to the budget  presentation aimed at improving transparency, accountability and focus. These  include: (a) revisions to the results framework, along with a streamlined  presentation and a focus on performance reporting; (b) the aggregation of financial  resources; (c) the integration into the proposed programme budget of the resource  requirements for special political missions under a separate budget section; and  (d) proposed adjustments to the budget structure.        Presentation of the results framework    38. In order to ensure greater alignment with the overall purposes and principles  of the Organization set out in chapter I of the Charter, as well as the recently  adopted Sustainable Development Goals and other major intergovernmental  agreements, the Secretary-General proposes altering the presentation of the results  framework. The programmatic narrative of the budget document would continue to  reflect the translation of legislative mandates into programmes and subprogrammes  for the budget period. The proposed narrative for each subprogramme would reflect  the following:    (a)  The overall framework of goals or purposes with which its work is  aligned;     (b)  The strategy for the implementation of related mandates;     A/72/492/Add.1    11/99  17-16667      (c)  The results to which it has contributed in the previous budget period, as  compared with the original plan for the same year;     (d)  Lessons learned and prior-period programme performance;     (e)  Planned results for the proposed budget period;     (f)  Main deliverables (outputs) planned for the budget period and achieved  in the prior period.   39. The above elements would replace the details reflected under ""objectives"",  ""expected accomplishments"", ""indicators of achievement"" and ""performance  measures"" in the current results framework. Figure III provides an example of the  newly proposed results framework for a sample subprogramme.        A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  12/99    Figure III  Subprogramme 2   Transport [for illustrative purposes only]                    1.  Within its overall framework and strategy, the following results frameworks show quantitative and  qualitative performance, lessons learned and plans for the subprogramme.    Results framework 1               For 2018, the subprogramme planned to provide guidelines to  Member States in order to achieve the finalization of at least  50 transport legal binding agreements (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  Road fatalities in the region between 2000 and 2013  (Thousands)        During 2020, the subprogramme will support Member States in the implementation of the 58 United Nations  transport conventions and agreements, and assist Member States in concluding an additional 10 instruments.  The subprogramme will also create related knowledge and facilitate discussions on sustainable transport.  MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   LESSONS LEARNED  2020 PLAN  Strong internationally agreed normative  frameworks support the effectiveness of road  safety related institutions at the country level  By 2018, 58 transport-related binding legal  instruments have been agreed upon by  Governments with the assistance of the  Department. These instruments have  contributed to a steady drop in road fatalities  over the past decade  OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to advocate and assist Member States in the  development of policy frameworks to foster sustainable inland  transport with a view to making it safe, clean and competitive    A/72/492/Add.1    13/99  17-16667    2.

They would be presented in  a more aggregated manner, giving prominence to the most significant activities (in  terms of resource use and contribution to results). The new presentation would also  show what had originally been planned for the previous budget year and the actual  performance. Planning and programming would continue to be guided by legislative  mandates for translating mandates into activities. The list of legislative mandates  would be provided as supplementary information to the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions and the Fifth Committee. Legislative mandates would also be reflected on  the websites of individual departments and offices.   41. The newly proposed format would further increase transparency and  accountability, since it would present, for the first time in one document, the  previous year's original programme plan, the measurement of the previous year 's  performance, the lessons learned and the programme plan for the proposed budget  year. Performance would be measured not only in quantitative, but also in  qualitative, terms. It is anticipated that information on results would be more  meaningful and would more effectively communicate the added value of the  Organization's work. The inclusion of lessons learned would support the role of the  Committee for Programme and Coordination in evaluating the performance of the  programmes. Annex III to the present report provides a prototype of the proposed  programme plan and budget for several programme sections, including a support  section, reflecting the changes proposed above.    A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  14/99        Aggregation of financial resources    42. Currently, financial resources are disclosed in the proposed programme budget  at the subprogramme level within most of the budget sections. Several  subprogrammes are included in each section, constituting its programme of work.  The Secretary-General proposes the aggregation of the resources for staff and  non-staff objects of expenditure at the level of the programme of work.   43.  This streamlining measure would ensure that the budget proposal to be  considered by the expert bodies and the General Assembly every year would be  concise, focused and manageable. This is an important and necessary step, because  without any change to the existing level of detail, an annual budget cycle would result  in a significant increase in the amount of documentation submitted for consideration.  In addition, the consolidation of each section's resources would better reflect the  reality of resource attribution, since programmatic activities often require the input of  staff and resources across different units within a given office or department.        Integration of special political mission budgets    44. At present, the proposed programme budget includes a total resource envelope  for the 36 currently existing special political missions, presented in a single budget  line under section 3, Political affairs, alongside the presentation of the other  sections. Detailed resource requirements are submitted in separate budget  documents annually and are considered by the General Assembly towards the end of  the main part of its session each year.  45.  Building on a previous proposal, the Secretary-General proposes the creation of  a new stand-alone section for special political missions and the inclusion of the  detailed requirements for these missions in the annual budget to be submitted through  the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to the Fifth  Committee, as is the current practice. Consequently, the Advisory Committee would  be in a position to consider these requirements along with the rest of the annual  budget in May and June each year (as opposed to October), and the integrated budget  and related reports could be submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly  in a timely manner, as shown in figure I. This enhancement would permit greater  transparency and would address the concerns repeatedly expressed by the Assembly  concerning the late submission of special political mission reports (see, for example,  resolution 71/272 A, sect. XIX, para. 4). In addition, the Assembly would no longer be  required to appropriate an envelope provision for special political missions. A  prototype is contained in annex IV to the present report.        Adjustments to parts and sections of the budget    46. The existing structure of the programme budget comprises two main levels,  the part being the higher level and the section the lower level. There are currently  36 sections grouped under 14 parts, with the thematically related sections included  within a given part. In some instances, however, a part contains only a single  section, which is contrary to the purpose of this two-level hierarchy.   47. The Secretary-General proposes the integration of all parts that are of a cross- cutting nature into a single cross-cutting part. This would include public  information, common support services, internal oversight, jointly financed  administrative activities and special expenses, and safety and security. Staff  assessment would remain separate, owing to its unique nature. As a result, the  number of budget parts would be reduced from 14 to 7.   48. With respect to the individual budget sections, the Secretary-General proposes  reducing their current number from 36 to 34, by integrating the regular programme    A/72/492/Add.1    15/99  17-16667    of technical cooperation, construction and the Development Account (sects. 23, 33  and 35) into the corresponding departments or offices and adding the new section  for special political missions.

Jointly financed  administrative activities  and special expenses new new   A/72/492/Add.1    17/99  17-16667    49. As regards the integration of the sections relating to the regular programme of  technical cooperation, construction and the Development Account, the relevant  resources would be segregated within the different budget fascicles and used  exclusively for their intended purposes. However, it is proposed that a summary  table be included in the foreword/introduction of the annual budget, reflecting the  total resources proposed for these three areas of activity.   50. Proposals concerning resources for the regular programme of technical  cooperation and the Development Account, including the related performance report  for the latter, would no longer be presented in a consolidated manner through a  separate report. Decisions on how to use these resources would be decentralized to  the implementing department. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the  Secretariat department that currently administers these funds, would consequently  retain only coordinating functions to ensure coherence and avoid duplication. As  regards construction-related capital expenditures, detailed resource justifications  would continue to be presented through the corresponding progress reports and the  Office of Central Support Services would continue to provide technical oversight  with respect to construction activities and related reports.  51. The above measures allow for a degree of streamlining, with fewer parts and  sections  and  a  concomitant  reduction  in  the  related  reports  requiring  intergovernmental and expert body review. In addition, in the case of the resources  related to the regular programme of technical cooperation, construction and the  Development Account, transparency and accountability for results would be  strengthened, with the allocation of the related funds to the responsible departments  and offices.       3.  Changes to the financial statements    52.  As required under IPSAS, the financial statements are now produced annually,  and that would continue to be the case under the Secretary-General's proposal.  However, the statements would be enhanced with additional information on the  financial performance during the prior budget period, in the light of the proposed  discontinuation of the first and second performance reports and the report on transfers  between sections. In particular, there would be greater disaggregation of information  on post and non-post expenditures and more detailed reporting of material variances  between budgeted and actual expenditures, which would increase transparency and  enhance reporting on the Secretary-General's accountability with regard to resource  utilization. Furthermore, the financial statements would include information on any  redeployments within budget parts, as described in paragraphs 53 to 58 below. The  statements would also contain information on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses  incurred pursuant to the authority granted by the General Assembly for that purpose  (see paras. 60-67 below). A prototype reflecting these new elements is contained in  annex V to the present report.        C. Exceptional funding and operational arrangements        1.  Proposed managerial authority to redeploy resources within budget parts and  between post and non-post objects of expenditure within sections    53. As indicated in paragraph 22 above, the Secretary-General, as chief  administrative officer of the Organization, currently has no existing standing  authority to redeploy resources between budget sections in order to address evolving  needs or to cover potential shortfalls that could hinder or curtail the implementation  of mandates within a given budget period. Furthermore, he does not have the ability  to transfer resources between post and non-post objects of expenditure without the  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  18/99    prior approval of the General Assembly (see resolution 55/231). Responding to  previous proposals for the establishment of a mechanism authorizing a degree of  managerial discretion in this regard, the General Assembly has approved the  establishment of certain limited authorities, subject to a number of restrictions and  on a time-limited and experimental basis.   54. The Secretary-General believes that, in order to make the Organization more  responsive to the demands of a fast-changing world and in the interest of making the  best use of existing resources before seeking additional resources, a simplified and  transparent mechanism to redeploy resources within the budget period would be  beneficial. The Secretary-General seeks the approval of the General Assembly for  two additional authorities to enable him to better manage the results of the  Organization.  55.  First, the Secretary-General proposes that an authority be granted to allow him  to redeploy post and/or non-post resources between sections grouped within the same  budget part. Any such redeployments would be reported to the General Assembly as  part of the enhanced financial reporting to be included in the enhanced financial  statements (see para. 52 above). All redeployments of resources across budget parts  would continue to require the prior approval of the General Assembly. Redeployments  would also be reflected on dashboards, as mentioned in paragraph 17 above, to  provide greater transparency during the course of budget implementation.  56. As a safeguard to ensure that resource levels approved by the General  Assembly are not altered significantly within the budget period, the Secretary- General proposes limiting the scope of such redeployments to 20 per cent of the  number of approved posts in the Professional and higher categories and/or the  approved non-post resources for each section. In addition, the use of this authority  would be based on the following principles:     (a)  The redeployment would not have an impact on mandate delivery in the  releasing budget section;    (b)  The requirements cannot be funded within the receiving budget section;    (c)  The requirements are of a one-time nature (specific to the current budget  period). If the requirements are of a continuing nature and would continue into a  subsequent budget period, provisions would initially be made through the authority,  and the continuing costs proposed in subsequent budget proposals;     (d)  The mechanism would be used, as a first resort, to meet programmatic  demands within the budget period, before additional resources are requested through  appropriation or commitment authority.   57. Second, the Secretary-General proposes that he be given the authority to  redeploy up to a level of 20 per cent of post-related financial resources to non-post  items within a section. This would allow for greater agility in terms of the kinds of  resources applied to a situation or in response to a mandate. It would enable him to  better manage the authorized level of resources. The use of that authority would be  based on the following principles:    (a)  The redeployment would support the delivery of mandates and activities  in the budget section;    (b)  The requirements would be of a one-time nature (specific to the current  budget period). If such resource distribution would be of a long-term nature, the  Secretary-General would make corresponding proposals in subsequent budget  proposals;     A/72/492/Add.1    19/99  17-16667      (c)  The mechanism would be used, as a first resort, to meet programmatic  demands within the budget period, before additional resources are requested through  appropriation or commitment authority.   58. With this limited degree of managerial authority, coupled with the appropriate  reporting and accountability requirements, the Secretary-General would have the  capacity to respond quickly to programmatic demands within a budget period. This  approach is in line with the Secretary-General's efforts to break down silos and  ensure that departments work more collaboratively in pursuit of the Organization's  mandates. Interdepartmental cooperation would be improved, and the focus would  move beyond department-specific activities towards Organization-wide priorities.  The resources allocated to the Secretariat would be used more collaboratively within  thematic areas to ensure the effective implementation of programmes and mandates  within those areas. The Secretary-General would not move resources between  thematic areas, for example, from development to peace and security or to human  rights and vice versa.  59. Should these proposals, along with other measures proposed in the present  report, be approved, the continuation of the existing experimental ""limited  budgetary discretion"" mechanism would no longer be necessary, and therefore the  Secretary-General proposes its discontinuation.      2.  Proposed broadening of the mechanism for the commitment of unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses    60. Under the existing budgetary process, the General Assembly adopts a  resolution at the same time as it adopts the biennial programme budget, granting the  Secretary-General the authority to enter into commitments up to prescribed limits  for unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. The prior concurrence of the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is needed if the  commitments exceed those prescribed limits. The prescribed limits have increased  over the years to keep pace with the needs of the Organization.   61. Currently, the Secretary-General is authorized to commit resources not  exceeding $8 million per year relating to the maintenance of peace and security and  an amount not exceeding $1 million for security measures related to premises and  staff. In addition, by its resolutions 66/258 and 70/250, the General Assembly  authorized the Secretary-General, with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee  on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, to meet expenses arising from Human  Rights Council and Security Council resolutions and decisions requiring urgent  action by the Secretariat.  62. The Secretary-General considers that this mechanism needs to be broadened  under his authority to respond to unforeseen developments in the areas of human  rights and development. Examples of situations in which this authority could have  proved useful are the global financial crisis of 2008/09 and the urgent conduct of  various investigations into alleged human rights violations.  63. Accordingly, the Secretary-General proposes that his authority to enter into  commitments in any given year be raised from $8 million to $16 million, which  would include provisions of $6 million for addressing unforeseen and urgent  development-related matters and $2 million to address unforeseen and urgent human  rights situations. Furthermore, in addition to the existing authority to cover  expenditures of up to $1 million in unforeseen security costs, he proposes that a  similar authority of $1 million be approved to address the immediate impact of  natural or man-made disasters on United Nations operations.   A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  20/99    64. The Secretary-General would report on the final expenditure incurred under  this authority in the audited financial statements. Taking into consideration final  overall programme expenditures as well as savings from the cancellation of prior- period obligations, he would, if necessary, request the General Assembly to  appropriate any related amount.        Use of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for special political missions    65.  In 1999, in an effort to expedite the deployment of Security Council-mandated  operations, the General Assembly introduced another element under its resolution  54/252 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. Under the resolution, the  concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions  must be sought for the Secretary-General to enter into commitments of up to  $10 million if a decision of the Council results in a need related to the maintenance of  peace and security. Beyond that amount, the Secretary-General is required to seek the  approval of the Assembly.   66. In his report on the review of arrangements for funding and backstopping  special political missions (A/66/340), the Secretary-General had proposed two  options to enable the Organization to fund start-up, expansion and transition  activities of special political missions. The first option entailed allowing special  political missions to access the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund on the same basis as  peacekeeping operations. As a second option, the Secretary-General requested an  increase in the current threshold, requiring the concurrence of the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, from $10 million to  $50 million. The Fifth Committee had deferred its consideration of the matter to the  seventy-second session.   67. In the light of the experience of recent years in which Security Council  decisions carried immediate financial implications in excess of $10 million, the  Secretary-General proposes an increase in this threshold to $20 million, instead of  the previous proposal of $50 million (see A/66/340). It is anticipated that that would  allow for more rapid start-up of new special political missions, such as the recently  created mission in Colombia, and speedier deployment of the related personnel and  initial infrastructure.      3.  Proposed adjustment to the level of the Working Capital Fund    68. The Working Capital Fund was established in 1946 to provide the advances  necessary to finance appropriations, pending the receipt of contributions, and to  finance unforeseen and extraordinary expenses pending appropriation action by the  General Assembly. Each biennium, the Assembly adopts a resolution by which the  Fund is re-established at a prescribed level. Member State advances to the Fund are  based on the size of the Fund and their rates of assessment in the first year of the  biennium.  69. While the level of the Working Capital Fund has increased periodically since  the inception of the Organization, it has not kept pace with the growth in the overall  level of the budget. During the biennium 2016-2017, the Fund level was authorized  at $150 million, an amount that had not been revised since 2007 (see resolution  60/283, sect. IV, para. 4). In 1946, at the time of its establishment, the level of the  Fund corresponded to approximately 30 weeks of expenditure, based on the  approved budget level at that time. In comparison, during the biennium 2016-2017,  the level of the Fund corresponded to just three weeks of regular budget  expenditure. Table 1 summarizes the evolution of the Fund, including its level in  relation to the approved budget level and the equivalent expenditure coverage.    A/72/492/Add.1    21/99  17-16667    70. Over the years, shortfalls in the Working Capital Fund have resulted in the  need to cross-borrow from peacekeeping accounts so that the Organization could  cover its costs during a period of up to five months in any given year. Sound  financial management necessitates the availability of adequate cash reserves so that  the United Nations can meet its financial obligations in a timely manner. In order to  avoid disruption in the activities of the Organization, the Secretary-General  considers it prudent that the Working Capital Fund be established at a level of at  least $350 million, representing approximately seven weeks of expenditure based on  the level proposed in the budget for the biennium 2018-2019.  71. As a comparison, in the Secretariat the guideline for general trust funds  establishes that 15 per cent of the expected annual expenditures of each project must  be maintained in cash, which represents 7.8 weeks of operating reserves. Another  example is the World Food Programme, which has an annual programme of work  amounting to approximately $5.3 billion.

The programme plan and budget is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development and the international commitments contained in the Addis  Ababa Action Agenda and the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. While some  subprogrammes contribute to a specific set of goals, others, given the nature of their  work, contribute to the overall sustainable goals, the Durban Platform for Enhanced  Action, and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.     The Department will continue to serve as a regional convener and facilitator in  building consensus, supporting public-policy formulation to meet the development  challenges facing the region, conducting and promoting multilateral dialogue and  sharing knowledge and networking at the regional and subregional levels. The  Department fosters a multisectoral approach to development and provides a voice to  countries in special situations, including middle-income countries, which constitute  a majority in the region (25 out of 42). In addition to its regular activities, the  Department will intensify its technical cooperation activities, including through the  regular programme of technical cooperation, provide assistance to build up capacity  in the national budget and fiscal areas within ministries of economy and finance.    The Department remains fully committed to pursuing continuous improvement  and efficiency in the delivery of its mandate while improving quality standards and  effective response to the demands of Member States.     The overall resources included in the present proposal amount to  $106,110,600, reflecting a net decrease of $820,400 compared with the  appropriation for 2019. Accommodating these budget adjustments while addressing  growing demands, has meant rethinking creatively the way we deliver our mandate,  by streamlining the analytical and normative work, as well as the provision of  capacity development and technical cooperation services, while preserving the  quality of our outputs. Implementation of the Department's programme continues to  benefit from resources under the regular programme of technical cooperation, the  Development Account and construction-related capital expenditures, as reflected in  the respective components, which have now been incorporated in this report.      (Signed) XXX  Under-Secretary-General                      A/72/492/Add.1    33/99  17-16667       Part I      Proposed programme plan for the year ending 31 December  2020 and programme performance for the year ended   31 December 2018         Supporting the Charter of the United Nations, the Sustainable  Development Goals and other main intergovernmental agreements      1.  Within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, the Sustainable  Development Goals and other main intergovernmental agreements, the Department  will implement its respective legislative mandates.  2.  Within its mandates, the Department presents a number of planned  deliverables which are expected to contribute to results, as highlighted under its  subprogrammes below, as well as its actual performance for 2018.        A. Overall orientation      3.  The overall purpose of the programme is to promote economic, social and  environmentally sustainable development through international cooperation, by  carrying out research and providing normative and technical cooperation services in  support of development efforts.  4.  The mandate derives from Economic and Social Council resolution 106 (VI),  by which the Council defined the role and purpose of the programme and indicated  that it should contribute towards the economic and social development and the  strengthening of economic relationships among countries.   5.  The programme will continue to provide support and contribute to the  development pillar of the United Nations, to foster economic integration at the  subregional and regional levels, to promote the implementation of ""Transforming  our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development"" (General Assembly  resolution 70/1), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International  Conference on Financing for Development (Assembly resolution 69/313), the  Durban Platform for Enhanced Action of the Conference of the Parties to the United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  together  with  the  internationally agreed sustainable development goals, and to facilitate sustainable  development by helping to bridge economic, social and environmental gaps between  and among countries in the region and the industrialized economies.  6.  To achieve the above, the programme will continue to respond to the needs of  Member States, serving as a forum and facilitator in building consensus, supporting  public policy formulation to meet the development challenges and promoting and  conducting multilateral dialogue, sharing knowledge and networking at the  interregional, regional and international levels, including with the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank.   7.  At the same time, a new global geopolitical map is taking shape, prompting a  rethinking of strategic alliances and lending greater weight and importance to  South-South relations. In that context, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda represents a change  in paradigm. The 2030 Agenda seeks to be a universal agenda that integrates the  economic, social and environmental dimensions as the core pillars of sustainable  development. Its implementation will represent significant changes in production  and consumption patterns and stake out a path towards greater equality between  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  34/99    genders and between generations, recognizing at the same time the importance of  eradicating poverty by 2030.   8.  In that regard, the programme would advocate a single universal sustainable  development agenda, with equality at its core and the following main priorities:  (a) improving macroeconomic stability and institution-building; (b) increasing  access to international financing and resource mobilization for development, as well  as improving public management; (c) enhancing productive potential and reducing  productivity gaps to achieve convergence, with a particular emphasis on innovation  and new technologies; and (d) promoting fiscal and social covenants, as well as the  implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable  Development Goals and the resulting strategies and public policies, including  policies and programmes on energy efficiency and climate change beyond 2020 that  take into account the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Climate  Change.   9.  The programme will continue to work to reinforce its leading role as the  convener of the regional coordination mechanism of the United Nations  development pillar, which reports to the Economic and Social Council and the  General Assembly.        B. Programme of work        1. Subprogrammes         Subprogramme 1  Natural resources and infrastructure [for illustrative  purposes only]                      10. Within the overall framework and strategy of subprogramme 1, the following  results frameworks show quantitative and qualitative performance, lessons learned  and plans for the subprogramme.              OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to provide research and systematized  information and data regarding the regulation and  management of natural resources and the provision of  public utilities and infrastructure services in the region,  also promoting a paradigm shift in public policies on  natural resources and infrastructure.    A/72/492/Add.1    35/99  17-16667   Investment ininfrastructure in the region, by sector.(as percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)Telecoms0.46%Water and sanitation0.33%Transport1.46%Energy1.26% Results framework 1        For 2018, the subprogramme planned to finalize and  distribute among Member States a database to ensure  comparability of statistics regarding the provision of  public utilities and infrastructure services in the region.  (See A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  .     During 2020, the subprogramme will continue its work to improve statistics on infrastructure for countries  in the region. It will incorporate the remaining 25 per cent of regional Member States, as well as new  indicators to the database, and all information will be available online. In addition, it will publish a study on  trends on infrastructure investment, providing comparable indicators among countries in the region.          MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   LESSONS LEARNED  2020 PLAN  In order to be able to formulate better  policies, countries require additional  statistics and related indicators.  In 2018, the database on infrastructure  investment in the region was finalized and  distributed among 75 per cent of the regional  Member States, which allows countries to  have comparable statistics on investment in  infrastructure, for the first time, which  supports policymaking.  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  36/99    Results framework 2       .   In 2018, the subprogramme planned to promote  cooperation and multilateral agreements on clean energy  (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))   In 2018, the subprogramme supported the  Clean Development Mechanism, in which  all regional Member States participated.  Following the establishment of the overall  principles to be followed in the  management of carbon emissions through  the Mechanism, a forum was organized by  the subprogramme in which Member States  agreed to take specific measures to address  carbon emissions. As a result, a 12-month  pilot cap-and-trade scheme was prepared by  two Member States, with full roll-out of a  national carbon market planned for 2020.  Much of Member States' experience of the  carbon market experience to date derives  from their participation in the Mechanism.      During 2020, the subprogramme will undertake at least three technical support missions to help additional  countries to implement pilot cap-and-trade schemes, which is expected to lead to agreement on a minimum of  two more such schemes.         MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLANLESSONS LEARNED 2020 PLAN  Further to promotion activities, countries request  follow-up support for subsequent implementation  steps    A/72/492/Add.1    37/99  17-16667    Results framework 3       .   In 2018, the subprogramme planned to publish a study  on technological innovation and foresight in the  energy sector (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))   At the request of Member States in the region and in  the light of the emerging challenges faced by  Member States with regard to water management,  the subprogramme instead published a study on  energy and water in 2018. The study contributed to  a new focus on the management of water for the  production of energy in the region, which will be  followed  by  a  meeting  organized  by  the  subprogramme,  with  the  participation  of  10 Member States, scheduled for 2019.        In 2020, the subprogramme will provide support to Member States to build their capacity to conclude  agreements for the construction of infrastructure that would increase the share of affordable and clean energy  in the energy mix of the region, which is expected to result in at least two such preliminary agreements.    11.

Within the overall framework and strategy of subprogramme 2, the following  results frameworks show quantitative and qualitative performance, lessons learned  and plans for the subprogramme.  OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to advocate and assist Member States in the  development of policy frameworks to foster sustainable inland  transport with a view to making it safe, clean and competitive    A/72/492/Add.1    39/99  17-16667    Results framework 1        For 2018, the subprogramme planned to provide  guidelines to Member States in order to achieve  finalization of at least 50 legally binding transport  agreements (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  Road fatalities ('000s) in the region between 2000-2013        During 2020, the subprogramme will support Member States in the implementation of the 57 United  Nations transport conventions and agreements, and assist Member States in concluding an additional  10 instruments. The subprogramme will also increase knowledge and facilitate discussions on sustainable  transport.            MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   LESSONS LEARNED  2020 PLAN  Strong, normative internationally agreed  frameworks support the effectiveness of road  safety-related institutions at the country level  By 2018, 58 transport-related binding legal  instruments have been agreed by  Governments with the assistance of the  Department. These instruments have  contributed to a steady drop in road fatalities  over the past decade  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  40/99    Results framework 2        For 2018, the subprogramme planned to assist at  least two countries in the region with accession to  the Customs Convention on the International Transport  of Goods under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR  Convention) (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))          During 2020, the subprogramme will support countries Y and Z with the accession process and continue to  provide support to Member States in the implementation of the Convention.         MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   LESSONS LEARNED  2020 PLAN  The longer time period required for the accession  process  of  country  Y  demonstrated  that  the  subprogramme, as part of its planning process, needs  to better understand the internal legislative processes  of the respective countries and initiate high-level  consultation with the relevant Government officials  TIR is the only universal customs transit system for  moving goods across international borders, for which  the United Nations became the custodian. In 2018,  with the assistance of the subprogramme, country X  acceded to the TIR Convention, bringing the number  of Contracting Parties to 70 on the five continents.  The accession of country X will foster economic  growth and development and facilitate subregional  and regional trade. However, accession of country Y  is still in progress    A/72/492/Add.1    41/99  17-16667    Results framework 3                   For 2018, the subprogramme planned to publish a study  on affordable and clean energy to change the regulatory  framework with regard to the linkages between clean  energy and health (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  The Transport Committee released a publication on  diesel engines which offers a balanced view on the  ongoing debate about the harmful effects of diesel  engine exhaust emissions on human health and the  environment. One of the conclusions is that truck and  locomotive drivers or people in toll booths are at high  health risk.            In 2020, the subprogramme will review the best practices and launch a campaign to promote clean energy  as well as new approaches for healthier working conditions for those professions in which people are  exposed to the harmful effects of emissions.    13.

Within the overall framework and strategy of subprogramme 3, the following  results frameworks show quantitative and qualitative performance, lessons learned  and plans for the subprogramme.      OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to provide advice and support to Member  States to enhance their capacity to develop, implement,  monitor and evaluate their gender equality policies and  promote economic opportunities for women    A/72/492/Add.1    43/99  17-16667    Results framework 1                   For 2018, the  subprogramme planned to  organize workshops with  three national Governments  to align their national  development strategies with  Gender Equality (see A/72/6  (Sect. 99))                In 2020, the subprogramme will support an additional 10 countries in the alignment of plans and budgets  to advance gender equality and women's empowerment and to protect women's human rights.      MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   The experience gained from helping countries  to prepare their national development strategies  illustrated the need to consider the budgetary  aspects in developing their gender equality  strategies  2020 PLAN  LESSONS LEARNED  With the assistance of the subprogramme,  countries X and Y have initiated the process of  incorporating the gender equality targets and  indicators, covering issues such as land reform  and the extension of health services to women in  informal jobs, contributing to the achievement of  their national development strategies 2016-2021  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  44/99    Results framework 2                   For 2018, the subprogramme planned to organize  workshops in support of advancing gender equality  and economic opportunities for women (see A/72/6  (Sect. 99))  In country X, the subprogramme established women- and-girl-friendly centres in the protection of civilian  sites, providing safe spaces for women to meet  regularly to network, share, discuss problems and  seek  assistance.  In  partnership  with  a  local  non-governmental organization, the subprogramme  provided training on vocational skills, literacy,  human rights, prevention of gender-based violence,  peacebuilding and reconciliation.           In 2020, the subprogramme will continue to support the establishment of safe spaces in internally displaced  persons camps and multipurpose women's centres in communities so that women and girls have increased  access to and use prevention and response services addressing violence against women, as well as access to  training on vocational skills, literacy, human rights, prevention of gender-based violence, peacebuilding and  reconciliation.      MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   The establishment of independent centres for  women only was critical in ensuring broader  participation of women in the various training  programmes, which helped improve their welfare  2020 PLAN  LESSONS LEARNED    A/72/492/Add.1    45/99  17-16667    Results framework 3                  For 2018, the subprogramme planned to organize  workshops and establish networks in support of  advancing economic and equal opportunities for  women (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  In 2018, the subprogramme enabled the funding of a  digital, mobile-enabled ""Buy from Women"" platform  for two cooperatives of nearly 700 farmers. By linking  women to broader markets and improving the quality of  production, use of the platform has led to large advance  contracts for crops, including with reputable firms.  Women farmers, who mostly never had access to such  opportunities before, are finding a sustainable exit from  poverty.           In 2020 the subprogramme will continue to help empower women to break discriminatory barriers, and claim  their rightful and equal roles in an inclusive economy through the provision of tailored training programmes.     15.

Within the overall framework and strategy of subprogramme 6, the following  results frameworks show quantitative and qualitative performance, lessons learned  and plans for the subprogramme.        OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy of the subprogramme is to advance the global statistical  system, including geospatial information, in order to produce high- quality, easily accessible, comparable and reliable data for monitoring  progress towards achieving the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development and to inform policymaking at the national,  regional and global levels    A/72/492/Add.1    53/99  17-16667    Results framework 1           For 2018, the subprogramme planned to facilitate  development and adoption of the global Sustainable  Development  Goals  indicators  framework,  including its dissemination, and provide capacity- building support regarding the statistical data and  indicators for the 2030 Agenda, for developing  countries (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  In  2018,  the  subprogramme  facilitated  the  development and adoption of the global Sustainable  Development Goals indicators framework, by the  Statistical Commission, the Economic and Social  Council and the General Assembly; provided robust  statistical data and indicators for the 2030 Agenda;  and  enhanced  capacity-building  support  for  developing  countries  by  disseminating  methodological  information  and  conducting  training.                In 2020, Department X will continue to coordinate the development of international statistical standards,  methods and guidelines, where necessary, to fully implement the global Sustainable Development Goals  indicators framework for monitoring progress towards the goals and targets. It will continue to facilitate the  implementation of the framework by devising home-grown and long-term statistical capacity development  programmes.        MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   National  statistical  systems  required  enhancements to meet the evolving needs of data  users, including for the implementation of the  2030 Agenda. Some countries are facing steeper  challenges than others and require context- specific  capacity-building.  Coordination  and  strategic leadership on data is needed, as well as  partnership,  mobilization  of  resources  and  coordination for statistical capacity-building   2020 PLAN  LESSONS LEARNED  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  54/99    Results framework 2           For 2018, the subprogramme planned to organize a  forum on the strengthening of the global data  ecosystem, including the review and follow-up of  the implementation of the Sustainable Development  Goals (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  In 2018, the subprogramme organized a forum for  coordination  and  dialogue  among  almost  400 delegates  from  over  90  countries  and  international organizations during United Nations  Initiative  on  Global  Geospatial  Information  Management.  The  session  promoted  common  principles,  policies  and  standards  for  the  interoperability  and  integration  of  geospatial  information and services with statistics and other  data sources which contributed to the strengthening  of the global data ecosystem and the review and  follow-up of the implementation of the Sustainable  Development Goals.        In 2020, Department X will continue to provide capacity-building activities and statistics on the alignment of  legal and fiscal arrangements with national priorities in support of the indicators for the 2030 Agenda for  developing countries.      21.

Within its overall framework and strategy of the regular programme of  technical cooperation, the following results frameworks show quantitative and  qualitative performance, lessons learned and plans for the programme.      OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to assist developing countries, especially  the least developed countries, in designing and  implementing policies and strategies to meet the objectives  of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  56/99    Results framework 1                For 2018, the Department planned to  assist two developing countries to  implement a tool for more  rigorous  and robust analysis for better planning  towards meeting the objectives of the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))    In 2018, the Department piloted the  development of the Climate, Land- use, Energy and Water Strategies  integrated system in countries X and  Y, which provided coherent and robust analysis  on  the  interrelations  of  natural resource  systems, strategic sectors such as energy and  climate change. The analyses informed national  development and sectoral planning.        In 2020, the full transfer of the Climate, Land-use, Energy and Water Strategies model tailored to countries X  and Y will be completed with a comprehensive and intensive hands-on training programme for government  officials in 2020.  Subsequently, a Development Account project will respond to other countries pursuing modelling -based  assessments to inform national 2030 Agenda strategies.       MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   There is demand to expand the pilot effort to other  countries. The complementary funding through the  Development Account would enable such scaled-up  efforts to support Member States in the development  of integrated system assessment methodologies  2020 PLAN  LESSONS LEARNED    A/72/492/Add.1    57/99  17-16667    Results framework 2                For 2018, the department planned to conduct  2 workshops  on  management  of  water  and  ecosystems (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))    In  2018,  the  Department  conducted  2 workshops on designing project proposals for  24 representatives of the Directorate of Water  and  Forests,  other  ministries  and  non-governmental organizations, which focused  on building the skills needed to prepare a Green  Climate Fund concept note and a pre-feasibility  study for the substantial overhaul of the forest  management system.   As a result two countries received a grant of  $5 million each from the Green Climate Fund to  support their forest management plans.             In 2020, the Department plans to replicate the project design workshops in five neighbouring countries with  similar ecosystems and institutional configurations.      The development of draft concept notes and outlines  for pre-feasibility studies, during the workshop,  facilitated successful resource mobilization  2020 PLAN  LESSONS LEARNED  MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  58/99    Results framework 3                For 2018, the Department planned to conduct   three workshops/seminars on double tax treaties  (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))    In 2018, the Department developed the United  Nations Course on Double Tax Treaties and  delivered it to approximately 70 tax officials  from 40 developing countries in Latin America,  the  Caribbean  and Africa  through  three  workshops. The course provided an analysis of  the treaty rules for the allocation of taxing  rights between countries over cross-border  income, as well as administrative provisions to  ensure effective application of tax treaties.           In 2020, the Department will expand the coverage to other developing countries in two additional regions.     23.

Within the overall framework and strategy of the Development Account, the  following results frameworks show quantitative and qualitative performance,  lessons learned and plans for the Account.    Results framework 1                For 2018, the Department planned to  provide technical assistance to at least three  developing countries for the development  of a methodology related to broader access  to regional and global markets and retail  chains for small size farmers (see A/72/6  (Sect. 99))  In 2018, the project provided technical  assistance to four developing countries on  the development of an inclusive framework  to regulate a broader access to regional and  global  markets  and  retail  chains.  Additionally, the project visited six remote  rural areas of two countries which have  recently enacted more inclusive agricultural  regulation and helped local farmers in signing  more than 50 agreements that enabled them to  have access to more advantageous conditions  that not only helped to increase production, but  also to sell their agricultural products under  more attractive terms and conditions.       OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to support developing countries in the development of  sound and complementary agricultural and trade policies that provide a  broader access to regional and global markets and retail chains for  small-size farmers, including female farmers  The hands-on approach and visits to remote rural areas has  been essential in facilitating the access of small farmers to  markets and retail chains, which ultimately enables them  to increase production and sell their products under more  attractive terms and conditions  LESSONS LEARNED  MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  60/99          In 2020, the project will continue to work on its legal framework to make it more flexible and easily adaptable  to the needs of an increasing number of developing countries and provide technical assistance to three more  countries. Furthermore, the project will engage with an additional 75 local farmers in remote areas to ensure that  they benefit from assistance that enables them to access more and bigger markets so that their products can be  sold under more attractive conditions.    25.

The amount of $XX,XXX,XXX, reflecting a decrease of $X,XXX,XXX  compared with the appropriation for 2019, would provide for the financing of XXX  posts and for non-post requirements, including other staff costs, travel of staff,  contractual services, general operating expenses, hospitality, supplies and materials  and furniture and equipment to support the implementation of mandates under the  programme.  34. Resource changes result from four factors, namely: (a) technical adjustments  relating to the removal of non-recurrent requirements and the biennial provision of  new posts established in 2019; (b) new and expanded mandates; (c) changes within  the section; and (d) other resource changes. The proposed resource level provides  for the full, efficient and effective implementation of mandates.  35. Resource changes in the amount of $XXX relate to the removal of  non-recurrent provisions in 2019 ($XX), offset in part by increased requirements  due to the biennial provision of five new posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 3 P-3) that were  established in the context of the budget period for 2019.   36. Resource changes reflect an increase of $XXX in support of new and  expanded mandates approved pursuant to the resolutions of the General Assembly  on: (a) Conference management, New York: Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations  Conference on the Least Developed Countries (General Assembly resolution  70/216); Universal Declaration on the Achievement of a Nuclear Weapon-Free  World (Assembly resolution 70/57); the thirty-fifth anniversary of the United  Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (resolution 70/69); the illicit trade in  small arms and light weapons in all its aspects (resolution 71/48); Transparency in  armaments (resolution 71/44); countering the threat posed by improvised explosive  devices (resolution 71/72); Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and  decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council during 2016 (A/71/272); and  the International Decade for Action, ""Water for Sustainable Development"", 2018- 2028 (resolution 71/222).  37. Resource changes reflect a reduction of $XXX, made possible by efficiencies  that the Department plans to bring about in 2020, specifically as a result of the    A/72/492/Add.1    67/99  17-16667    streamlining and automation of a number of administrative processes and the  increasing use of electronic methods of communication, including for the conduct of  meetings.  38. The resource changes as a result of the aforementioned factors would translate  to a net decrease of $XXX under post resources and $X,XXX,XX under non-post  resources.  39. Decreased requirements under post resources include:    (a)  The proposed establishment of 1 P-3 Economic Affairs officer in support  of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council during 2018  and the International Decade for Action, ""Water for Sustainable Development"", 2018- 2028. The economic affairs officer will be responsible for XXX.    (b)  The proposed abolishment of 3 Administrative Assistant posts as a result  of efficiencies that the Department plans to bring about in 2020.   40. Decreased requirements under non-post resources reflect efficiencies that the  Department plans to bring about in 2020, offset in part by increased requirements  under the projects funded from the Development Account.  41. During the year 2020, expected extrabudgetary resources amounting to  $X,XXX,XXX will be utilized to cover programme support costs related to various  technical cooperation projects.        D. Management, support and construction-related capital expenditures          Resource requirements: $X,XXX,XXX     42. The resource requirements for the programme of work are shown in table 6  below.

Resource changes result from four factors, namely: (a) technical adjustments  relating to the removal of non-recurrent requirements and the biennial provision of  new posts established in 2019; (b) new and expanded mandates; (c) changes within  the section; and (d) other resource changes. The proposed resource level provides  for the full, efficient and effective implementation of mandates.  45. Resource changes in the amount of $XXX relate to the removal of  non-recurrent provisions in 2019 ($XX).   46. Resource changes reflect an increase of $XXX in support of new and  expanded mandates approved pursuant to the General Assembly's resolutions on  Conference management, specifically the Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations  Conference on the Least Developed Countries (General Assembly resolution  70/216), and the Universal Declaration on the Achievement of a Nuclear Weapon- Free World (Assembly resolution 70/57).  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  70/99    47. Resource changes reflect a reduction of $XXX, made possible by efficiencies  that the Department plans to bring about in 2020, specifically as a result of the  streamlining and automation of a number of administrative processes and the  increasing use of electronic methods of communication, including for the conduct of  meetings.  48. The proposals include requirements in support of major maintenance and  construction projects in the amount of $XXX, as provided for in the Secretary- General's progress report on the strategic heritage plan. [Details of the major  maintenance projects will be presented in supplementary and construction project  details/status will be presented in the relevant progress reports]  49. The resource changes as a result of the aforementioned factors would translate  to a net decrease of $XXX under post resources and $X,XXX,XX under non-post  resources.  50. The decrease of $XXXX under post resources reflects;    (a)  The proposed outward redeployment of one post of Procurement  Assistant (Local level) to executive direction and management to support certifying  and monitoring functions related to changes in procurement practices, policies and  thresholds following the implementation of Umoja;    (b)  The proposed abolishment of one post of Integrated Management  Information System Coordinator (P-4), one post of Associate Translator, English  (P-2), two posts of Property and Inventory Control Assistant (Local level) and one  post of Travel Assistant (Local level), reflecting efficiencies that the Department  plans to bring about in 2020.     (b)  Decreased requirements under non-post resources, reflecting the outward  redeployment of resources to the programmatic area to cover the cost of external  printing and specialized services for the graphic design and layout of the flagship  publications and other non-post reductions resulting from efficiencies that the  Commission plans to bring about in 2018-2019.  51.

XX          A/72/492/Add.1    75/99  17-16667       Foreword         Special political missions serve as an important tool for the Organization for  advancing the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in  particular in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security, but also  in the areas of development and human rights.     Today, special political missions are increasingly deployed to active conflicts;  a substantial portion of mission personnel, as well as the vast majority of United  Nations peacekeepers, now work in countries experiencing conflict or political  instability.     In order to operationalize the good offices of the Secretary-General, special  political missions continue to work hard to bring peace to areas ravaged by conflict.  They are one of the most important United Nations mechanisms for achieving this  goal, and they play a crucial role, often facing long odds, in helping to end some of  the defining conflicts of our time. And, despite the significant challenges, they  continue to work towards defusing tensions, rallying parties around peace  agreements, helping countries step back from the brink of conflict and build a  sustainable peace.     Despite numerous challenges, the operations of special political missions have  resulted in positive developments. Countries X and Y continued their progress in  their political transitions, allowing the Security Council to end the existing  sanctions regimes and dissolve the respective expert groups. The mission in country  A stepped up its good offices activities during an intense electoral season; the  mission in Country B facilitated dialogue among political stakeholders; and the  mission in region C, undertook several missions to countries undergoing elections,  experiencing political crises or consolidating democratic governance. Given the  increasing complexity of the operations of special political missions, they continue  to work very closely with other United Nations actors on the ground and partner  with the wider United Nations system.    In 2020, the ongoing challenges for special political missions may continue  and new challenges may arise. These challenges may be difficult but not impossible  to solve. Hence, these operations must continue to fulfil their mandated purpose and  work towards international peace and security. Special political missions are a tool  for dealing with a number of critical peace and security issues of our day, capable of  reducing tensions and foster peaceful solutions to conflicts.       (Signed)  Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs        A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  76/99       Part I     Overall orientation [information previously contained in the  introduction to the chapeau]       1.  The overall purpose of the special political missions is the maintenance of  international peace and security, to be achieved by assisting Member States in  resolving potentially violent disputes or conflict peacefully, in accordance with the  principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions emanating from  the General Assembly and the Security Council. The mandates of special political  missions are derived from the pertinent resolutions of the Assembly and the  mandates of the Council, which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance  of international peace and security. To help Member States prevent armed conflict,  the special political missions deploy tools of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking  and peacebuilding, including in partnership with a range of international, regional  and other organizations.   2.  Special political missions will continue to support Member States in their  efforts towards the prevention of armed conflicts through diplomatic means,  sustaining peace and peacebuilding, including in partnership with international,  regional and subregional organizations, international financial institutions, civil  society organizations, women's groups, youth organizations and the private sector,  taking into account national priorities and policies, in accordance with relevant  mandates.  3.  In 2019, the operating environment for special political missions work  continued to increase in complexity. Terrorism, transnational organized crime, arms  proliferation,  rising  intercommunal  tensions,  environmental  degradation,  fragmented power structures and institutional fragility are now common features in  many of the countries to which special political missions are deployed or on which  they work. As the challenges that these missions face have become more complex,  so have their mandates and institutional design. One of the most significant  characteristics of special political missions today is the diversity in mission  functions and structures. They range from small offices of special envoys carrying  out a good offices mandate and regional offices with a preventive function to  monitoring teams, groups and panels overseeing Security Council sanctions regimes  and field-based missions carrying out specialized mandates such as electoral  observation, all the  way  to  complex,  multidimensional operations  with  comprehensive mandates to support fragile transitions and sustain peace.   4.  Throughout their history, special political missions have been deployed to a  diverse set of contexts, in particular with regard to existing political, socioeconomic  and security conditions. Their functions have increased in complexity over the years  and have also varied, ranging from conflict prevention or facilitation of peace  agreements to specialized tasks, such as assisting Member States in border  demarcation or disarmament activities, and a wide range of peacebuilding activities.  Special political missions are expected to respond flexibly to the broad range of  situations in which Member States require support.   5.  The historical experience of special political missions shows that the tools  available to them can be adapted and fine-tuned to the specific needs of a particular  situation, in line with the mandate that the United Nations is requested to perform  and deliver. This diversity of mission models is readily demonstrated by a  comparison of missions such as special political mission XX, YY, ZZ.  6.  Today, roughly 90 per cent of special political mission personnel work in  missions covering countries experiencing high-intensity conflict. In a number of  operational environments, the Organization is exposed to violence. Given the    A/72/492/Add.1    77/99  17-16667    civilian nature of special political missions, these contexts present an increasing and  direct challenge to the ability of the Organization to stay and deliver. Over the past  few years, the Organization has explored a number of different options for ensuring  the security of special political missions in the field, such as the deployment of  United Nations civilian security personnel, increased cooperation with regional  partners that may have military personnel on the ground and the use of private  security companies (local companies, in the majority of cases).   7.  Close cooperation with regional and subregional organizations is paramount to  the success of United Nations conflict prevention, peacemaking and peacebuilding  engagements. Special political missions remain at the forefront of this cooperation  and work closely with their regional counterparts. In many instances, cooperation  with regional or subregional organizations is a core part of their mandate.   8.  The mandates of the special political missions included in the current report  are renewed periodically for varying periods of time. Of the XX special political  missions presently in operations mandates of XX have been renewed and those of  the remaining XX are expected to be renewed by the General Assembly of the  Security Council. A list of special political missions together with the status of the  renewal of their corresponding mandates is provided in annex I.         Part II      Special political mission proposed plans for the year ending  31 December 2020, performance for the year ended  31 December 2018 and proposed resources per special  political mission          Thematic cluster XX     XXX [Cluster name] [for illustrative purposes]       9.  Thematic cluster XX comprises nine special political missions of special  envoys, special advisers and special representatives of the Secretary-General. The  overall resources proposed for the budget period 2020 amount to $$$$$$,  representing a reduction of $$$$ (or XX per cent) compared with the appropriation  for 2019. For 2020, the resource proposal includes one new mission (XXXXX) and  two discontinued missions (XXXXX and XXXXX). After taking into account the  changes in the number of missions, the resource proposal for 2020 represents a 2 per  cent increase compared with the approved level for the seven continuing missions of  2020.        United Nations Assistance Mission in country X         Background and mandate     10. Subsequent to the incidents affecting country X, the United Nations decided to  establish a special political mission to assist the stabilization of the country.  11.  Through several resolutions from the Security-Council and General Assembly,  the latest of which is General Assembly resolution 70/XXX, the General Assembly  requested the Secretary-General to continue to provide his good offices and to  pursue his discussions on human rights, democracy and reconciliation in country X,  involving all relevant stakeholders, and to offer technical assistance to the  Government in that regard. At the request and on behalf of the Secretary-General,  the Special Adviser has continued to work towards the implementation of the good  offices mandate for the country.   A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  78/99    12. Further to the elections held on 8 November 2018 and the new political  environment, the Special Adviser, through comprehensive engagement with the  authorities and other relevant stakeholders within and outside the country, continued  to work for progress in three broad areas: (a) encouraging the country X authorities  to continue to pursue and consolidate the process of democratization and, in so  doing, to engage more openly with the international community; (b) supporting the  work of the negotiating teams of the Government and ethnic armed groups for the  implementation of the nationwide ceasefire agreement signed in October 2016  between eight ethnic armed groups and the Union Government, in addition to  engaging with groups that did not sign the Agreement, with a view to bringing them  back to the peace process; participating in talks with domestic and international  stakeholders on issues relating to the Union Joint Monitoring Committee as part of  the implementation of the Agreement; and (c) engaging with officials and civil  society organizations within and outside country X to advocate the taking of steps to  end institutionalized discrimination against the Muslims in country X.  13. The Secretary-General and his Special Adviser continued to engage closely  with relevant Member States in implementing the good offices mandate. In addition  to participating in bilateral meetings in New York and the region, the Special  Adviser briefed the Security Council on 25 February.  14.

OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy is to engage in strategic partnerships and  dialogues  with  the  Government,  the  military,  communities and international and civil society actors in  priority  areas,  including  freedom  of  expression,  elimination of violence against women and prevention of  torture    A/72/492/Add.1    79/99  17-16667        For 2018, the Mission planned to conduct regional  consultations  on  human  rights  themes  with  all  stakeholders  (see  A/72/6  (Sect. 99))  In  2018,  the  Mission  conducted  11  regional  consultations and recorded  the views and concerns of  240  civil  society  representatives from 22 provinces with respect to their  own experiences concerning the exercise of the right to  freedom  of  expression,  which  contributed to a  substantial reduction in the detention of journalists who  expressed views contrary to the Government.    In 2020, the Mission will intensify its efforts to organize and convene regional consultations which benefit  from the participation of the Government so that the right to freedom of expression is strengthened and the  detention of journalists will be prevented.    16.

For  2018,  the  Mission planned to  focus  on  the  coordination required  to address the newly  emerged  humanitarian  crisis  in the north of the  country (see A/72/6  (Sect. 99))  In 2018, the Mission organized 14 high-level meetings  with national stakeholders and humanitarian partners on  humanitarian coordination and principles to be observed in  the preparation of contingency plans which subsequently  enabled humanitarian partners to provide assistance to 5.8  million people impacted by the crisis in the country.  Operational presence and coverage have increased  significantly and thematic clusters are performing more  effectively, while response and delivery have improved in  both speed and quality as compared with 2017.  MEASUREMENT OF 2018 PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN   OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY  The strategy, in close collaboration with the United  Nations country team, is to coordinate the action of the  humanitarian partners, and to develop a harmonized and  integrated  delivery  of  essential  services  during  emergency situations  .

In 2020, the Mission will continue to facilitate the dialogue between the Government and tribal  representatives, which will focus on outstanding issues, including the independence referendum, disputed  boundaries and territories, oil exports, revenue sharing and the voluntary return of displaced persons to  their homes.     22.

Within its overall framework and strategy, the following results frameworks  show quantitative and qualitative performance, lessons learned and plans for the  Mission.      For 2018, the Mission planned to step up its work to  support the Government in holding its first national  elections since 2010 (see A/72/6 (Sect. 99))  In 2018, the Mission supported the Government in  coordinating  national  elections,  helped  secure  accommodation for more than 100 electoral observers  and worked in conjunction with the United Nations  Development Programme on the retrieval of ballots  from facilities across the country for counting, using  its air assets. An independent audit concluded that the  process was transparent and well conducted and  considered these to be the first fair democratic  elections in the country.          In 2020, the Mission will intensify its capacity-building efforts, including the creation of internal structures  and rosters of registered electoral observers to ensure the transparency of future elections.    24.

The statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts (statement V)  presents the difference between budget amounts, which are prepared on a modified  cash basis, and actual revenue and expenditure on a comparable basis.   2.  Approved budgets are those that permit expenses to be incurred, including  income estimates, and are approved by the General Assembly. For IPSAS reporting  purposes, approved budgets are the appropriations and income estimates authorized  by Assembly resolutions.   3.  The original budget for the year ended 31 December 2020 is the budget  approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 74/248 A to C. The final budget  represents final amounts appropriated and income estimates for the year ended  31 December 2020, after the incorporation of all changes arising from General  Assembly resolutions 74/252 and 75/263, as well as the redeployments authorized  by the Secretary-General pursuant to resolution X/XX. Actual revenue and  expenditure amounts are all the commitments and actual amounts incurred in the  period on a budget basis.  4.  Explanations for material differences between the original and final budget  amounts, and between the final budget amounts and actual revenue and expenditure  on a modified cash basis, that are deemed to be greater than 5 per cent are included  in tables 1 and 2.  5.  The overall final budget for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to  $2,899.3 million, compared with the original budget of $2,851.9 million, reflecting  an increase of $47.4 million for the budget period. The main areas of increase are  reflected in table 1.          A/72/492/Add.1    97/99  17-16667        Table 1       Material differences between the original and final budget amounts for the year  ended 31 December 2020     Budget section  Material differences of more than 5 per cent      5. Disarmament  Relates primarily to increased requirements of $0.4 million approved  by the General Assembly in its resolution 73/400 on the field of  information and telecommunications in international security  24. Human rights   Relates primarily to increased requirements totalling $5.0 million in  support of the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights  Council at its twenty-fifth to twenty-seventh sessions and its twenty- first and twenty-second special sessions, approved by the General  Assembly in section VIII of its resolution 74/262   27. Humanitarian affairs  Relates primarily to the appropriation of requirements totalling  $32.0 million for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General on Ebola and the United Nations Mission for Ebola  Emergency Response pursuant to General Assembly resolution 74/274       6.  In addition, during the period, pursuant to General Assembly resolution X/XX,  authorizing the Secretary-General to redeploy resources within budget parts, an  amount of $1.0 million was redeployed to section 29E, Office of Information and  Communications Technology, to address cybersecurity threats. The amount was  redeployed from two sections: section 29C, Office of Human Resources Management  ($0.5 million), and section 29D, Office of Central Support Services ($0.5 million).  7.  The overall final expenditures for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted  to $2,861.6 million, compared with the final budget of $2,899.3 million, reflecting a  net decrease of $37.7 million (comprising reduced requirements under non-post  resources in the amount of $53.9 million, offset in part by an increase of  $16.1 million under post resources). Explanations for material differences between  the final budget and actual expenditure on a modified cash basis that are deemed to  be more than 5 per cent are included in table 2.        Table 2       Material differences between the final budget amounts and actual expenditures  for the year ended 31 December 2020  [The information below is based on a sample number of sections]  Budget section  Material differences of more than 5 per cent  1.     1. Overall policymaking,  direction and  coordination  Reduced requirements in the amount of $1.5 million under non-post  resources reflect primarily the need for fewer judges owing to the  lower number of cases considered by the Appeals Tribunal   2. Political affairs  Reduced requirements of $5.1 million under post and non-post  resources result from higher vacancy rates compared with the  budget, and delays in the recruitment of consultants owing to the  security challenges relating to Boko Haram and the organization of  the general elections in Nigeria.  5. Disarmament  Increased requirements of $0.5 million under post and non-post  resources reflect primarily lower average vacancy rates experienced  compared with the budgeted rates  A/72/492/Add.1      17-16667  98/99    Budget section  Material differences of more than 5 per cent  1.     6. Peacekeeping  operations  Reduced requirements of $3.8 million under non-post resources  reflect lower requirements for travel within the United Nations  Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan area owing to  security and visa restrictions imposed by one host Government, as  well as the travel of staff from the United Nations Truce Supervision  Organization due to a lower number of trips to conferences and  training sessions during the year  8. Peaceful uses of  outer space  Increased requirements of $0.3 million under post resources reflect  lower average vacancy rates compared with budgeted rates. For  non-post resources, the lower requirement of $0.2 million relates to  the lower number of workshops organized during the period than  planned, as a result of the decisions of the Committee on the  Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in June 2020  9. International Court of  Justice  Increased requirements of $0.8 million under post resources reflect  lower average vacancy rates compared with budgeted rates. For  non-post resources, the reduced requirement of $1.9 million under  temporary assistance for meetings was due to the lower number of  cases for review during the period, which translated into a reduced  number of meetings and sessions of the Court   10. Economic and social  affairs  Reduced requirements of $2.5 million under non-post resources  reflect lower requirements for the travel of representatives, owing  mainly to fewer delegations and representatives of policymaking  organs travelling than initially planned. This was due in part to a  number of overlapping consultations with the high-level political  forum on sustainable development   11. Office of the High  Representative for the  Least Developed  Countries, Landlocked  Developing Countries  and Small Island  Developing States  Reduced requirements of $1.5 million under post resources reflect  higher average vacancy rates compared with the budgeted rates  12. New Partnership for  Africa's Development  Reduced requirements of $2.1 million under post and non-post  resources were related mainly to higher average vacancy rates  compared with the budgeted rates   13. Trade and development  Reduced requirements of $1.0 million under non-post resources were  due mainly to the lower number of representatives who attended  meetings than initially planned, and to reduced requirements for  mail and pouch services and paper supplies due to the increased use  of electronic dissemination of information       8.  The utilization of the unforeseen and extraordinary expenses granted under  General Assembly resolution X/XX for the year ended 31 December 2020 is  reflected in table 3.

They included: slow,  unresponsive service delivery, fragmentation in management structures, inadequate  resourcing, ineffective mandate delivery and a lack of transparency and accountability.  In my report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"", I suggested a transformation of the Organization,  based on sound management principles, to make the United Nations more nimble,  effective, transparent, accountable, efficient, pragmatic and decentralized to better  support its normative and operational activities and indicated that I would implement  an ambitious reform agenda.     I suggested a new management paradigm that would empower managers to  determine how best to use their resources to support programme delivery and mandate  implementation. This will also mean transferring greater responsibility to managers  and holding them accountable for the programme and financial performance of their  programmes. It will not be a blanket delegation, but will be based on a careful  consideration of the capacities of managers to receive greater delegation of authority  and their abilities to properly execute it. Support to managers will be improved by  streamlining and simplifying the policy framework, providing clear guidance and  restructuring the current management and support departments to better support  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  2/246    delivery of all programmes and provide all managers with quality assurance and  strategic policy guidance.    On 24 December 2017, the General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266, welcomed  my commitment to improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on its  mandates through management reform and indicated that it looked forward to  receiving a comprehensive report on my proposals. The present report contains my  proposals for reorganizing the current management structures at Headquarters to  enable and ensure the accountable exercise of delegated authorities in support of  effective and full mandate delivery, including through the elimination of duplicative  functions, the establishment of a clearer division of roles and responsibilities and  segregation of duties, and the assurance of appropriate checks and balances. The  reorganization will lead to the creation of a Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance with a clear policy, strategy and compliance role and a  Department of Operational Support focused on operations, services, transactions and  surge support to entities in weak environments. Both departments will service and  support the entire Secretariat -- at Headquarters, the regional commissions and offices  away from Headquarters and in the field.    Reform processes, by their very nature, tend to focus largely on measures to  improve the current system. It is also important, however, to celebrate our many  achievements and to recognize that reform has been an ongoing process. My reforms  will build on the achievements of past and ongoing reform efforts, as well as the  lessons learned from their implementation.     I wish to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of men and women who serve the  Organization with pride and dedication, often in very difficult and dangerous  environments. Our reform efforts are aimed at helping them to perform their tasks with  greater ease and with fewer bureaucratic impediments.

Introduction       1.  As our world witnesses a global landscape devastated by human suffering  through conflict, humanitarian crises, human rights abuses, natural disasters,  increasing environmental challenges, and economic and social inequities, the  purposes and principles of the United Nations, established more than 70 years ago,  remain relevant and vital. Yet to maintain the confidence of the international  community, the United Nations must demonstrate its ability to adjust in order to keep  pace with and address, effectively and accountably, these contemporary challenges to  international peace and security, economic and social development and respect for  and protection of human rights.   2.  Taken together, my reports on the repositioning of the United Nations  development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  restructuring the United Nations peace and security pillar, and shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations1 set out a road map for strengthening  our capacities to deliver on the promises envisaged by ""we the peoples"" at the  founding of our Organization. While they are proceeding on different tracks, our  efforts are aimed at achieving the same goal: a more effective Secretariat that delivers  better on its mandated activities and uses its resources more effectively. Management  reform will underpin and support the advancement of that goal in all areas of our  work. I am grateful for the receptivity and support of Member States in each of these  reform streams.   3.  My report on shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations identified  a number of internal obstacles that prevent the Secretariat from optimally achieving  the purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations in the current global  environment. These include the Secretariat's centralized and cumbersome  management structure and administrative framework. With their origins in supporting  the work of the Organization in a bygone era, current practices are often insufficient  to respond to the scope and increased challenges of mandates entrusted to the  Organization by its Member States and do not adequately take into account the fact  that the overwhelming majority of the Secretariat's financial and human resources are  committed to mandated activities outside of Headquarters.   4.  Adjustments to the management framework, structures and procedures will  enable and support renewed vitality and innovation across the Secretariat and the  United Nations system as a whole to fully support the promise of the United Nations.  Building on best practices and lessons learned through previous and ongoing reform  measures, these management reform proposals maintain the overarching goal of  bringing decision-making closer to the point of delivery, simplifying rules, policies  and procedures, decentralizing authority and enabling interoperability across the  United Nations system to enhance the impact and effectiveness of our efforts. They  will address the unintended consequences of previous management reforms. For  example, while the streamlining of contractual arrangements under General Assembly  resolution 63/250 has allowed for greater consistency in the application of staff rules  and administrative issuances and eliminated major barriers for the movement of staff  between Headquarters and the field, harmonization generally occurred against  policies and processes originally developed for Headquarters contexts, significantly  reducing the flexibility required to meet volatile and increasingly challenging  conditions in the field.   5.  Other proposals serve to implement the recommendations of previous reforms.  For example, the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations highlighted the  __________________    1  A/72/124-E/2018/3, A/72/525, A/72/492 and A/72/492/Add.1.    A/72/492/Add.2    7/246  18-04386    general need for a more field-focused framework to better support field operations  and mandate delivery. While this was intended to apply to our peace operations, it is  equally a concern for other entities within the Secretariat, including the offices away  from Headquarters and the regional commissions. As part of the follow-up to the  report of the Panel, process reviews identified key bottlenecks and recommended  measures to improve process efficiency, including increased delegation of authority  to senior managers, strengthened governance, evaluation and monitoring  mechanisms, and updated and improved underlying policy frameworks to address the  challenges of high-tempo operations. Many of these recommendations can be, and are  being, addressed through my management reform.  6.  Central to the success of this reform is the alignment of resource management  authority and mandate delivery responsibility through my proposed paradigm shift to  decentralize management structures and delegate authority to make decisions closer  to the point of delivery, supported by streamlined processes and procedures and  greater accountability. On the one hand, this paradigm shift will enable senior  managers across the Secretariat to take effective, timelier action that is better attuned  to the requirements of a particular situation or country context and to balance  operational and managerial risk. On the other, it will make it possible to more  adequately address risks and fairly and transparently hold senior managers to account  for results.   7.  Shifting the United Nations management paradigm requires considerable effort  to develop simplified, common sense policies, procedures and processes; a  rationalized delegation of authority framework that achieves a proper segregation of  roles and responsibilities and aligns programme/mandate delivery and managerial  responsibilities and accountabilities; and data-based business intelligence and  analysis to support management decisions and enable effective and timely monitoring  and robust compliance and accountability measures. Work is progressing in all of  these areas.  8.  The proposed reorganization of the existing Department of Field Support and  the Department of Management into two new departments -- the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational  Support -- aims to ensure that United Nations management structures better support  all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.   9.  In its resolution 72/266, the General Assembly welcomed my commitment to  improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on its mandates through  management reform and indicated that it looked forward to receiving a  comprehensive report on my proposals for its consideration.   10. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request and seeks the approval  of the General Assembly of the structural and staffing proposals set out in the report.  If approved by the Assembly, the structures proposed in the present report will be  established as from 1 January 2019. The restructuring of the two departments is post- neutral and respects the resource levels approved by the General Assembly in 2017  for the regular and peacekeeping budgets. New functions will be created within  existing resources through the reassignment and redeployment of existing posts. Over  time, full implementation of the reforms is expected to yield a range of benefits,  including improved effectiveness of mandate delivery, improved transparency and  accountability and enhanced confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deliver  on the mandates entrusted to it by Member States. Some additional financial resources  may be required to lay the foundation necessary to establish the new structures as  from 1 January 2019, including for aligning capacities with the level of additional  delegations of authority, training and transfer or possible agreed separation of staff,  which may be required in exceptional situations. The extent of these requirements is  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  8/246    still being determined. No additional resources are being requested of the Assembly  for such requirements. Instead, the Secretariat will seek to meet them, to the extent  possible, through voluntary contributions.         Management culture and leadership    11.  In order to fully realize the benefits envisaged from the shift in the management  paradigm, the Organization will need to address existing shortcomings in  management culture and leadership, as noted in my report entitled ""Shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations: ensuring a better future for all"" (see  A/72/492, para. 100). As indicated in that report, the United Nations must move to a  culture that is focused more on results than on processes, better manages  administrative and mandate delivery risks, values innovation and demonstrates a  higher tolerance for honest mistakes and a greater readiness to take prompt corrective  action (ibid., para. 15). Leadership should be norm-based, principled, inclusive,  accountable,  multidimensional,  transformational,  collaborative,  self-applied,  pragmatic and action-oriented.   12. In the past two years, the Secretariat has conducted several assessments to better  understand the current culture. The staff engagement survey showed that 88 per cent  of staff are proud to work for the United Nations and find it a place that respects  racial, cultural and religious diversity. However, additional consultations with  stakeholders across the Secretariat characterized the current Secretariat culture as:     * Hierarchal, bureaucratic, procedural with a reliance on using rules and valuable  time to justify mistakes rather than emphasizing better planning, compliance- oriented with a ""check-the-box"" mentality, Headquarter centric and inefficient     * Internally competitive and siloed, leading to mistrust and risk aversion, as well  as conflicting or redundant activities     * Needing managers who invest in staff, engage staff and utilize performance  management processes and tools well     * Lacking accountability and transparency  13. These assessments demonstrate that the Secretariat has key positive areas to  leverage, while revealing many areas to address and strengthen.   14. Changing the management culture and leadership in the United Nations  Secretariat will require action at every stage of the talent management cycle. Key to  this will be the creation of a revised set of organizational expectations, expressed as  leadership and management competencies and focusing on observable behaviours.  During recruitment and selection, potential senior leaders and managers will be  assessed to determine whether they possess the desired competencies in the context  of overall organizational requirements. Mobility, within and outside of the United  Nations, should be promoted, allowing staff to leave and grow in key managerial and  leadership behaviours and then return to the United Nations for the benefit of the  Organization. In developing talent through learning and performance management, it  should be emphasized that receiving feedback and improving in those competencies  is positive and demonstrates the ability to grow and correct course. Additional  evidence will be obtained concerning how managers and leaders best learn and apply  learning, and this information will drive the development of new programmes and  tools to achieve the desired change in behaviours. These observable behaviours will  also be woven into tools like 360-degree evaluations, so that managers and leaders  can be provided with valuable feedback on their actions. Knowledge management is  an additional enabler of change and will be integrated into learning activities and  tools to help leaders and staff to harness good practices, break down silos and develop  common values across the system. The Department of Management is also    A/72/492/Add.2    9/246  18-04386    undertaking a readiness assessment of the performance management framework to:  (a) enable a more agile approach; (b) foster a culture of ongoing dialogue; (c) shift  from the current focus on compliance; and (d) promote collaboration and greater  accountability for results.   15. In order to enhance transparency, and in line with the new competencies, leaders  will be expected to use data when establishing measurable key performance  indicators. Senior leader compacts will be linked to departmental, divisional,  sectional, team-based and individual work plans. Performance data will inform  continuous performance dialogue within departments, sections and teams and will be  used to assess impact, readjust approaches, develop staff and learn from mistakes to  achieve better results. Such dialogue, grounded in long-term development and built  through trust, need to be at the cornerstone of all manager-staff relations. Networking  will be promoted and provided for more transparently to increase collaboration, break  down silos, increase innovation and spread good practices. Furthermore, data will be  made widely available to staff, continuously improved for quality and accuracy and  used to make informed decisions. Learning and mentoring will also be provided to  senior leaders so that they may develop the necessary skills to implement this  approach.  16. Human resources policies are being simplified. Further review will be necessary  to align policies with new leadership and management competencies, once they are  approved, and to ensure that the policies are forward-thinking and reflect current and  future talent in the organization. This policy simplification will go hand in hand with  the delegation of authority to managers, which will be accompanied by transparent  data on the consistent application of that authority. The data will expose areas in  which policies need further refinement. The Secretariat will align any changes to  existing and new policy frameworks across the development and peace and security  pillars to reinforce accountability and transparency across the United Nations and  build on good practices.   17. The results of the United Nations staff engagement survey and client satisfaction  surveys will be widely shared with staff to promote transparent and honest  engagement. Senior leaders will be required to submit action plans to demonstrate  how they will embrace and address the feedback received from their staff and clients  through such surveys. The Secretary-General will hold senior leaders directly  accountable for delivering their action plans, thus contributing to sustainable  organizational change.   18. Further analysis will be conducted to determine what kind of rewards drive staff  to perform well and deliver high-impact results, and the findings will be used to  improve accountability mechanisms. The findings will also be used to promote  innovation and informed risk-taking. Greater transparency and consistency regarding  rewards and sanctions will reinforce accountability, and efforts will be made to  accelerate the dismissal process for staff and managers who do not achieve the desired  results or who do not exhibit the required competencies.  19. The new leadership and management competencies must be applied starting at  the highest levels. The Secretary-General and senior management will need to exhibit  and advocate for the new competencies, as this will demonstrate to all staff that the  competencies will apply even at the highest levels. Feedback from staff through  biannual employee engagement surveys, and better application of performance  management standards across the Organization, should lead to positive changes in  behaviour that are visible to staff and management, Member States and other external  clients. Finally, the desired changes in management culture and leadership should be  expressed across all aspects of the United Nations, not only during recruitment,  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  10/246    learning and performance management, but in all the communications and actions  undertaken by the United Nations and its staff at all levels.         Impact of management reform on ongoing initiatives     20. Umoja is already a key enabler of important strategic reform initiatives such as  the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the information  and communications technology (ICT) strategy and is poised to support other  initiatives such as enterprise risk management, the global service delivery model and  the internal control framework. It will be a critical enabler of the Secretary-General's  management reform in simplifying processes, improving responsiveness to  challenges in the field, enabling the decentralization of authority with concomitant  monitoring and oversight, and increasing transparency and accountability for results.  Umoja has paved the way for enhanced and faster client services, better business  continuity and more rapid deployment. The globalization of operations in a single  system has also created additional opportunities for greater access to faster or cheaper  intra-Secretariat services and for leveraging such efficiencies for more fit-for-purpose  business models.   21. The Umoja Extension 2 strategic planning, budget formulation and performance  management solution to be deployed in September 2018 will enable planning and  reporting on utilization of resources based on results frameworks, including  contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. This will include risk-based  dashboards for programme delivery, which will permit visualization of the impact of  United Nations work through performance indicators. With the ability to link  resources to results frameworks, the entire life cycle of a budget, from formulation  through execution and finally to performance reporting (including evaluation), can be  managed in an integrated fashion, reducing the time needed to build and aggregate  budgets or to review and sign off on them. The ability to retrieve detailed information  quickly (or access it remotely, if needed) can also speed up legislative reviews. The  implementation of an annual budget will be facilitated by this project.  22. Umoja Extension 2 also includes modules that are critical to the success of the  implementation of the supply chain management approach, including in demand  planning, supply network planning and transportation management. Improvements in  enterprise resource planning tools will promote greater transparency, allow further  streamlining of processes and facilitate best value for money by leveraging economies  of scale and improving Organization-wide planning, inventory management and  delivery optimization. The consolidation of procurement and logistics into an  integrated end-to-end office of supply chain management will position the Secretariat  to take full advantage of the future Umoja modules.         II. Overview of the new structure       23. The reorganization of the two existing departments into two new departments  will support the paradigm shift to an effective decentralized Secretariat management  framework that equips and empowers senior managers to meet their programme and  mandate delivery objectives. The proposals set out in the present report reflect the  principles brought to the attention of the General Assembly in my report on shifting  the management paradigm of the United Nations (A/72/492), specifically: unity of  command and purpose; clarity of roles and responsibilities; and empowered  delegations of authority that are rational, holistic and decentralized as far as possible,  within an established risk framework, in which risk assessments are supported by  analytics and individual oversight data and the exercise of delegated authority is  supported, monitored and designed so that form follows function.     A/72/492/Add.2    11/246  18-04386    24. The existing departments were established at different times and for different  purposes. The mandate of the Department of Management encompasses the full range  of authorities for the management of human, financial and material resources for the  entirety of the Secretariat. The remit of the Department of Field Support is focused  on dedicated support to peacekeeping and special political missions, as well as United  Nations support to the African Union Mission in Somalia, operating within  management authorities delegated to it by the Department of Management, which the  Department of Field Support subdelegates. The differing scope of the mandates and  delegated authorities results in inconsistent levels and types of service to different  types of entities across the Secretariat. Moreover, the division of responsibilities  between the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management in the  support of peace operations is often unclear. Piecemeal delegations of authority,  duplication of effort, the design and application of policies originally crafted for  non-mission settings and repetitive processes with multiple departmental handover  points all contribute to lengthy timelines and diluted accountability for such critical  business processes as budget formulation, recruitment and procurement. Delayed  management action and support creates frustrations in both departments, in peace  operations and among Member States.   25. Moreover, many of the services delivered by the Department of Field Support  to peace operations are also required by other parts of the Secretariat. In fact, many  departments and offices already benefit from some of these services. For example,  the pools of rostered candidates built through exercises managed by the Field  Personnel Division are available for use across the Secretariat. The Geospatial  Information Section of the Information and Communications Technology Division  provides geospatial and cartographic services to the entire Secretariat. The  Information and Communications Technology Division also supports the  requirements of the international criminal tribunals and the International Residual  Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and the monitoring of the information and  communications technology infrastructure across the Secretariat is currently  centralized at the Global Service Centre and run as an enterprise service by the  Department of Field Support. The current reform offers an opportunity to ensure that  the operational support provided by the Department of Field Support is more  systematically available across the entire Secretariat.   26. Similarly, while the services provided by the Department of Management are  global, the reform will ensure that strategies, policies and compliance mechanisms  apply across the Organization, including peace operations. The proposed new  structure is designed to deliver tailored solutions to account for different clients, with  a robust performance management framework supported by the organizational  structures, staffing and technology required for transparent and efficient operations.  By separating management strategy, policy and compliance from operations and  ensuring that both departments support the entire Secretariat within their clearly  defined roles and responsibilities, the Secretariat will be able to eliminate duplication,  streamline processes, create synergies and provide more timely and effective  management support to programme and mandate delivery across the Secretariat.   27. In recent years, the Secretariat has undertaken several initiatives to improve the  ability of missions to deliver in the field. These include the September 2017 guidance  on mission support structures, which addressed identified shortfalls and incorporated  recent developments in best practice, such as the adoption of the supply chain  management approach, the expansion of shared services, the implementation of the  environmental strategy and the further development and deployment of Umoja. Over  the next two financial periods, field missions will implement a standardized structure  whereby directors and chiefs of mission support will oversee three pillars within their  mission support components: an operations and resource management pillar, a service  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  12/246    delivery management pillar and a supply chain management pillar. The key change is  the introduction of the operations and resource management pillar, which will provide  greater coherence in forecasting, monitoring, planning and coordination by uniting  cross-cutting mission support functions. This initiative is separate from, but  complementary to, both the management reform and the global service delivery  model. The proposed structure of the Department of Operational Support includes  clear counterparts to each of the three proposed pillars, which will facilitate the  delivery of operational advice and support from Headquarters to missions, among  other clients, and enable them to responsibly exercise their delegated authorities.   28. While addressing the structural challenges to effective and accountable mandate  delivery is critical and is the subject of the present report, it will not be sufficient to  ensure that the Organization is able to deliver. The reorganization of the management  structures at Headquarters to facilitate the paradigm shift to a decentralized  Secretariat must be accompanied by a strategic and comprehensive review of the  Organization's regulatory framework to support the new management paradigm and  reflect the reality that the bulk of the activities of the Secretariat -- representing the  overwhelming majority of its human and financial resources -- take place outside of  Headquarters duty stations. Such a review has been initiated under the leadership of  the Department of Management, and a new human resources management strategy, as  well as proposed amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations, in full alignment with the management reform principles, will be presented  to the General Assembly for its consideration during the main part of its seventy-third  session. Beyond these measures, however, the Secretariat must undergo a longer-term  culture shift to allow for the full benefits of the various streams of reform to be  realized.   29. While the present report focuses on the structures of the proposed Department  of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the proposed Department of  Operational Support, it cannot be stressed enough that the focus of the management  reforms is on the empowerment of the nearly 100 discrete departments, offices,  regional commissions, tribunals and field operations that make up the Secretariat and  that the new management structures exist to support these client entities in delivering  their mandates effectively and accountably. Moreover, many of the services currently  provided by offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions to other  offices in the same duty stations are the type of services that will be provided by the  Department of Operational Support in the future. In order to minimize disruptions in  support and to leverage the specialized knowledge and relationships that have been  built up over time, the Secretariat envisages that the offices away from Headquarters  and regional commissions will continue to deliver location-dependent services, on the  one hand, and operational support functions to their existing clients on behalf of the  Department of Operational Support, on the other.         Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance     30. Under the new paradigm, the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will facilitate the timelier, more effective, transparent and accountable  delivery of mandates across the Secretariat. It will provide policy leadership in all  management areas through a clear, integrated global management strategy and policy  framework and through strengthened monitoring, evaluation and accountability  mechanisms that oversee the exercise of delegated authorities in a decentralized  management paradigm. It will contribute to a culture of continuous learning and  accountability and promote innovation in business models throughout the Secretariat,  with a strong focus on the field.   31. The Department will encompass three pillars: a finance and budget pillar  responsible for policy and guidance on all strategic issues related to programme    A/72/492/Add.2    13/246  18-04386    planning, budgeting, finance, and programme and financial performance; a human  resources pillar providing strategic direction and policy leadership in the area of  human resources; and a business transformation and accountability pillar which will  combine capacities for monitoring and evaluation, risk management, organizational  performance measurement and support to business transformation and innovation.  The Department will also, jointly with the Department of Operational Support,  manage the activities of the Office of Information and Communications Technology.   32. The Office of Finance and Budget will act as the central provider of policy,  instruction, guidance and advice for all programme planning, budgeting, finance, and  programme and financial performance across the Secretariat. It will develop and  promulgate policy on financial and budgetary matters. It will ensure a culture of  responsible, transparent and accountable fiscal management, in which financial  resources are planned, utilized and reported in an effective and efficient manner.   33. The Department will play a key role in shaping the organizational culture,  including through enhancing diversity, organizational development and leadership,  learning, career support and performance management. The Office of Human  Resources will provide strategic direction and policy leadership in all human  resources matters. The Department will align the Organization's human resources  capacity with its mission and mandates through the development and refinement of a  global human resources strategy and innovative policies based on both organizational  and staff needs.   34. The Office of Human Resources will monitor emerging human resources  management issues throughout the Secretariat and manage staff-management  relations by ensuring the effective participation of staff in issues relating to staff  welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of life and other human  resources policies. The Office will also be responsible for administrative law and  conduct and discipline matters for the entire global Secretariat.   35. Central to the activities of the Department will be the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division, which will establish and mainstream accountability  systems to drive a results-based culture and the proactive management of risk. By  leveraging the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja and other  enterprise solutions, the Division will use business analytics to provide real-time  support on performance to senior managers and other internal and external  stakeholders and will conduct management reviews and quality assurance functions  in a cycle of continuous improvement. It will review the findings and  recommendations from the oversight bodies and will support managers in self- evaluation activities from which they and the Organization can learn and improve  planning and decision-making. It will also continually seek opportunities to  modernize and innovate and will manage large-scale business transformation  projects.   36. The Department will be responsible for the development, implementation and  monitoring of an enhanced delegation of authority framework that clearly aligns  authority with responsibility and for monitoring its application. Delegations of  authority will be underpinned by a clear and simplified policy framework, which will  be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that it is effective and efficient in  supporting the delivery of mandates and the added accountability associated with  clearly delineated roles and responsibilities across the Secretariat.   37. On management issues, the Department will represent the Secretary-General  before relevant expert and intergovernmental bodies, such as the Advisory Committee  for Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Fifth Committee and the  International Civil Service Commission, as well as inter-agency coordination  mechanisms, including the High-level Committee on Management of the United  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  14/246    Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), and in the conduct  of staff-management consultations.         Department of Operational Support     38. The proposed Department of Operational Support will be the operational arm of  the Secretariat and the client-facing interface for operational support matters in the  new management structure. It will have two main functions: to support decision- making by empowered senior managers through advisory capacities closely focused  on the point of delivery; and to support the implementation of decisions through  operational support, including shared transactional services. In addition, it will  support entities within the Secretariat, such as small offices at Headquarters or in the  field, that lack either a dedicated executive office or administrative unit or the  capacity to meet the demands of surge requirements or unusual circumstances. In  exceptional circumstances, the Department will exercise delegated authority on  behalf of entities or field operations, such as during mission start-up or when the  Secretary-General has withdrawn delegations of authority at the recommendation of  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   39. The Department will broadly be organized into four pillars: an operational  support pillar that will be responsible for advisory capacities and operational  activities that benefit from consolidated global planning and execution; a shared  services pillar that will perform location-independent and administrative tasks and  other corporate services through shared service centres; a special services pillar that  will provide cross-cutting support, such as planning and analysis, exercise delegated  authority on behalf of clients to whom authority has not been delegated or from which  delegated authority has been withdrawn, and support start-up, surge, transition and  downsizing activities; and an administration division responsible for day-to-day  support, including in facilities  management, information technology and  administrative services to clients at Headquarters. Detailed information on the shared  services pillar is presented separately in the report of the Secretary-General on the  global service delivery model for the United Nations Secretariat (A/72/801).   40. The Department will also jointly manage the activities of the Office of  Information and Communications Technology.   41. When clients require advice on the exercise of their delegated authority, their  business partners would be their first point of contact. The advisory capacities within  the Department of Operational Support will serve as a resource for business partners.  For cases requiring exceptional policy clarification, the Department of Operational  Support will seek the guidance of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance. Having a consistent approach to providing advice to clients across  the Secretariat will address many of the challenges faced today and will facilitate  analysis of trends related to the types of issues that affect clients.   42. The operational support pillar of the Department will consist of the Office of  Support Operations and the Office of Supply Chain Management, each of which will  be led by an Assistant Secretary-General.   43. The Office of Support Operations will consist of the Human Resources Services  Division, the Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health Division  and the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service. The Office of  Supply Chain Management will draw upon the combined resources of the existing  Logistics Support and Procurement Divisions to allow the Organization to have the  right goods and services at the right place, the right time and the right cost, all while  ensuring the requisite segregation of duties. In addition, a dedicated Uniformed  Capabilities Support Division will integrate the activities currently performed by  different parts of the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management    A/72/492/Add.2    15/246  18-04386    that support the end-to-end force generation, deployment and reimbursement process,  and will serve as a single point of entry for support issues related to military and  police contingents, thereby improving the quality of interaction with troop- and  police-contributing countries.   44. The Division for Special Activities will oversee a range of specialized or  cross-cutting operational capacities. A large part of its responsibilities will be to  support start-up, surge, transition and liquidation requirements and to exercise  authority on behalf of entities to which authority has not been granted owing to a lack  of capacity or from which authority has been temporarily withdrawn. The Division  for Special Activities will also include a cross-cutting Resource Planning and  Analysis Section, an operational planning capacity to identify and plan for emerging  support requirements and a dedicated support partnerships capacity to manage  relationships with non-Secretariat entities that the United Nations has been mandated  to support, such as the African Union or the Group of Five for the Sahel.   45. Finally, the Division of Administration will provide dedicated support to clients  at Headquarters similar to the support provided by directors of administration in the  offices away from Headquarters. Support provided by the Division will include  business partner functions for offices in New York that lack a dedicated executive  office, visa and travel services, facilities management, and local information and  communications infrastructure and technical support.         Office of Information and Communications Technology     46. A single Office of Information and Communications Technology will be  established through the consolidation of the existing Office of Information and  Communications Technology in the Department of Management and the Information  and Communications Technology Division in the Department of Field Support. As  this Office will both perform some policy- and standard-setting functions and deliver  operational support to clients throughout the Secretariat, it will retain reporting lines  to both the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. Given that  ICT is a cross-cutting function underpinning the Organization's core mandates and  activities, a single entity to cover the Organization's operations and business  processes from end to end under a single integrated structure with a holistic approach  to the delivery of ICT services will meet client needs. ICT is driven by the rapid pace  of technological change. The placement of strategy, policy and compliance functions  within the same office as ICT operations will enable rapid and responsive service  delivery, particularly in relation to standards and architecture, and will facilitate  continual updates and improvements to the compliance framework. The unified ICT  structure will allow the Organization to leverage the gains already made and to  expedite the remaining elements of the ICT strategy. It will also enable an agile  approach and leverage technology and innovation to enable the core work of the  Organization.         Management Client Board     47. The Management Client Board, an internal management body co-chaired by the  heads of the two new departments, will serve as a feedback mechanism between the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of  Operational Support and client entities. Membership will include rotating  representatives of each of the different types of client entities across the Secretariat,  namely, departments and offices at Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters,  regional commissions, peace operations and field-based offices of special advisers  and envoys. The Board will serve as a mechanism by which the different types of  clients can ensure that the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  16/246    Compliance and the Department of Operational Support are aware of and better able  to address their particular requirements and concerns, thereby improving the ability  of the two departments to best support all Secretariat entities in achieving the  purposes of the Organization and delivering on the mandates established by Member  States. Where an operational requirement is identified, the Board will also feed into  policymaking processes, including the development of field-specific policies, if  required.         III.  Delegation of authority       48. The Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations,  as established in article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations. Currently, the  Secretary-General delegates administrative authority to the Under-Secretary-General  for Management, who may then subdelegate it. Under the current delegation of  authority framework, there is no consistency in how the various types of authority are  delegated and subdelegated. They may be delegated ad personam or by function. They  may be delegated fully or partially. Whether a senior manager in a particular entity  has a higher degree of delegated authority than another manager -- if that particular  manager has delegated authority at all -- is generally more a matter of past practice  than a structured assessment of risk or responsibilities. When the level of delegated  authority is insufficient for the execution of required tasks, decisions must be taken  elsewhere, where there may not be as much knowledge about the specific  requirements or context, introducing delays in implementation. Furthermore, in most  cases, authority is delegated directly to directors of administration or directors of  mission support, bypassing entirely the head of the entity, to whom mandate delivery  is entrusted. Altogether, the existing system entrenches a misalignment of the  responsibility for mandate delivery and the authority needed to manage the financial,  human and material resources required for mandate delivery. The misalignment both  impedes managerial action and dilutes accountability. The General Assembly, in its  resolutions 53/221, 64/259 and 71/314, has articulated concerns about the functioning  of the existing system of delegation of authority, and the incremental measures taken  in the past to address those concerns have largely been ineffective, as noted by the  Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection  Unit. The Board of Auditors also recommended that the Administration review,  update and rationalize the current delegations of authority.   49. The General Assembly, in its resolution 71/283, stressed the need for the  Secretary-General to address the deficiencies in the current delegation of authority  system through the promulgation of well-defined roles and responsibilities of  individuals at all levels to whom authority is delegated, systemic reporting  mechanisms on monitoring and exercise of delegated authority and actions to be taken  in cases of mismanagement or abuse of authority. To that end, the Secretariat  undertook a comprehensive mapping of the flow of the current delegations of  authority. During 2018, a comprehensive review of the existing authorities and an  assessment of individual capacities and monitoring requirements will be completed.   50. To meet these challenges, the Secretary-General has decided to delegate directly  to heads of entities across the Secretariat the full administrative authority needed for  the effective stewardship of their financial, human and material resources. This step  aims to provide for a more effective delivery of mandates in a streamlined and  transparent manner, thereby also strengthening accountability. Ad personam  delegations of authority will be replaced by functional delegations of authority, so  that managers recruited against specific functions will be selected and maintained in  their positions on the basis of their ability to responsibly and accountably exercise  those delegations. Furthermore, to the extent possible, authorities should be aligned    A/72/492/Add.2    17/246  18-04386    with responsibilities in order to ensure a chain of command and accountability that is  clear and unambiguous. The scope of the delegation of authority necessary to carry  out the responsibilities entrusted to the head of an entity will be determined by the  Secretary-General, on the basis of guidance from the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the Department of Operational  Support, from a rational, risk-based menu of options. Under the established risk  framework, the risk assessment will be supported by analytics and individual  oversight data, while the exercise of delegation of authority will be supported,  monitored and designed so that form follows function. The default starting position  will be full delegation, but specific delegation portfolios will be tailored to each entity  based on its capacity and capability to exercise delegations in an accountable manner.  In circumstances in which capacity gaps exist, the Department of Operational Support  will exercise the delegated authorities and, where appropriate, work with the senior  manager concerned until such time as the required capacity has been developed to the  satisfaction of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   51. To ensure a clear line of responsibility and accountability, heads of entities will,  in turn, be responsible for subdelegating their authorities to others in the entity, based  on functional responsibilities.   52. The requirements for the implementation of each delegation will be established  by the Secretary-General upon review and recommendation by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the  Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. The Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating  compliance with the delegation of authority framework, including whether  circumstances have arisen that justify the curtailment of any delegation, in whole or  in part. In such cases, upon the recommendation of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management, Strategy, Policy and Compliance, the Secretary-General will take  remedial action, including by limiting, redirecting or withdrawing the authority in  question. The Department of Operational Support will then work with the entity in  question to enhance its capability until such time that the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance is confident that the entity can responsibly exercise  the delegated authority.   53. To reflect the direct delegation of authority from the Secretary-General and the  fact that the Department of Management will no longer exist, the relevant financial  and staff rules will be revised to reflect the change in modalities for the delegation of  authority. In accordance with standard practice, all amendments to the financial and  staff rules will be presented for the information of the General Assembly.   54. Greater delegation of authority to managers, supported by strengthened risk  management and accountability frameworks, will enable the responsible stewardship  of the resources of Member States, a more responsive and proactive United Nations  and, therefore, improved programme and mandate delivery.         IV. Accountability      55. Today it is often difficult to hold individual managers accountable for specific  decisions or actions, owing in large part to the complex nature of policies and  processes and the convoluted delegations of authority that result in many layers in the  decision-making process. Senior managers throughout the Secretariat often point out  that, while they are responsible for implementing mandates and delivering results,  they do not have control over all the resources they need to manage their programmes.  The Secretariat cannot be effective with decisions being controlled away from the  operational realities, or with responsibility for resources delegated to anyone other  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  18/246    than those entrusted with mandate delivery. By greatly simplifying resource  management policies and processes and aligning resource management delegations  of authority with programme and mandate delivery authorities and responsibilities,  managers can be held to full account for what they achieve and deliver and the  resources expended and decisions taken to that end. In return, the Secretary-General  will require full accountability and transparency. The Secretary-General will delegate  authority directly to senior managers and they will be directly accountable to him.   56. The Secretary-General is determined to create a culture of empowerment and  accountability, ensuring that leaders, managers and staff have the ability and tools to  achieve their goals as they conduct their own work and take collective action.  Managers must have the necessary authority to fulfil their responsibilities to  contribute their part to mandate implementation. It must be communicated clearly to  managers what is expected of them and that their performance will be measured  against clear and fair standards in their exercise of delegated management authority  and programme and mandate delivery.   57. In order to better support managers, the Department of Management is  reviewing the current policy framework and procedures to ensure that they are clear  and up to date. In 2017 and 2018, several outdated administrative instructions were  abolished and others are currently being revised and simplified. Finance, human  resources and procurement manuals will be revised and updated to ensure that  managers and staff are clear on their respective roles and responsibilities and the  procedures to be followed. Senior managers and staff will be further supported  through the restructuring of the Department of Management and the Department of  Field Support into one department with responsibility for defining the Organization's  management strategy and policies and ensuring compliance, and another providing  support in the implementation of policies, as well as operational and transactional  support. The new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will  act as the Secretary-General's agent in providing the necessary horizontal quality  assessment and monitoring across the Organization and in holding United Nations  officials to account for their performance. Depending on the nature of a detected  problem, responses could range from providing additional policy guidance or  capacity-building or implementing managerial tools to revoking the delegated  authority or imposing administrative and disciplinary measures, as appropriate, in  accordance with the Staff Regulations and Rules.  58. The United Nations has in place an individual and institutional accountability  framework to promote compliance, transparency and the effective stewardship of  resources in the delivery of mandates, which is summarized in the formal definition  of accountability established by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/259. The  framework comprises a number of elements, including a body of regulations and rules  governing the activities of the Secretariat and a number of structures intended to  address different aspects of accountability within the Organization. In this regard, it  is the Secretary-General's intention with the reform proposals to simplify the existing  regulatory framework by means of a comprehensive policy framework review and the  development of clear and simplified policies and administrative guidance over the  coming year, supported by a baseline of simplified processes and procedures that can  be more easily applied by staff, thereby enabling informed, robust and accountable  decision-making.   59. Key aspects of managerial responsibility and accountability at all levels are also  detailed in the seventh progress report of the Secretary-General on accountability  (A/72/773). Managers will be delegated greater decision-making authority in the use  of resources to support programme delivery and mandate implementation. Training  and support will be provided in the proper use of that delegated authority. Senior  managers will be supported by two departments in their use of the delegation of    A/72/492/Add.2    19/246  18-04386    authority (see paras. 50-53 above). In this context, the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will develop an organizational policy framework  that facilitates effective management and resource use in support of programme  delivery. The Department of Operational Support will provide transactional,  operational and advisory support. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance will monitor the use of the delegation of authority to ensure that it is  in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Organization, the policy  framework and internal controls.   60. The Organization as a whole, and its individual staff members, will be held  accountable for delivering agreed results, while complying with regulations, rules and  ethical standards. They will also be expected to proactively identify and manage risks  that threaten the achievement of their objectives. Performance, both programmatic  and managerial, will be systematically monitored, evaluated and reported.  Programme managers will take corrective actions in order to keep plans on track, and  lessons learned will be used to inform future planning. Programme planning and  performance information will be updated and reported to Member States on an annual  basis, in the context of the annual programme budget document. In addition,  programme and financial performance of individual programmes will be reflected on  dashboards, which will be updated on a quarterly basis. The dashboards will be  accessible to Member States and staff.  61. The strengthening of the implementation of results-based management, the  redirection of the efforts of staff at all levels towards the achievement of the  Organization's objectives and goals and the shift in the focus of the Secretariat's  efforts from inputs and activities to results and outcomes will be important elements  of the accountability framework. A dedicated results-based management function in  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will work with  individual departments, offices and missions to ensure that the results to be achieved  are reflected in all planning documents and flow from the Organization-wide planning  and budget documents, down through the senior managers' compacts and are reflected  in individual staff workplans. The Board of Auditors has repeatedly recommended the  development of a detailed plan for embedding results-based management throughout  the Organization. To that end, the implementation of an action plan to ensure that  results-based management is embedded in the work of the Organization will be  initiated in 2018. It will reflect the recommendations of the Board of Auditors  regarding the importance of visible leadership from senior management in promoting  and advancing the accountability system as a whole by setting an appropriate tone at  the top to drive forward the implementation of results-based management, the need  to build a strong culture of self-evaluation by programme managers and the  importance of using performance measures that reflect the main expected  accomplishments of a department and that are helpful to managers trying to  understand current performance (see A/69/5 (Vol.I), chap. II, para. 30, and A/71/5  (Vol. I), chap II, para. 93).   62. Transparency to Member States will be further enhanced through online  dashboards that provide programme performance information and results of self- evaluation and lessons-learned exercises and a portal presenting expenditure  information extracted from Umoja in an interactive and accessible manner.   63. Risk management will be a priority. The Secretary-General's vision supports an  approach to risk management that is pragmatic and action-oriented, taking principled  and practical action to deliver on mandates, balancing administrative and operational  risks and erring on the side of action when necessary to prevent and address human  suffering. The Secretary-General is introducing a ""three lines of defence"" model,  which will clarify essential roles and responsibilities for risk management and  internal controls within the Organization and improve the effectiveness of the risk  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  20/246    management systems. Under this model, the first line of defence is the managers and  staff who own and manage risks in their areas of operation. The second line of defence  is the centralized, business-enabling functions focusing on compliance and risk  management activities. The third line of defence is the Office of Internal Oversight  Services, which provides senior management and the General Assembly with  independent assurance regarding the effectiveness of risk management and internal  controls, including on the manner in which the first and second lines of defence  achieve their objectives. The Board of Auditors, as the external auditors of the  Organization, as well as the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent Audit Advisory  Committee, play an important role in the control structure and will provide additional  independent assurances of the effectiveness of the controls and the use of financial  resources. While they reside outside the Organization's structure, they provide  independent, external assurances to the General Assembly.  64. With the proper implementation of an effective ""three lines of defence"" model,  and the current and additional internal control systems that will be put into effect with  the reforms, the overall level of risk will not increase because adequate capabilities  to monitor and control risk will have been created. The main change will be an  enhanced awareness among managers of their responsibility to identify and  proactively manage risks in their areas of responsibility and that they will be guided  and supported as necessary.         V. Financing arrangements      65. During its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations (A/72/492), the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions requested information on the use of the  peacekeeping support account and how it may be adapted for the new management  structures, given that both departments will serve the entire Secretariat and not just  peacekeeping operations (see A/72/7/Add.24, para. 39 (b)). As decided by the General  Assembly in 1995 in its resolution 49/250 and regularly reaffirmed in the years since,  the support account for peacekeeping operations exists to finance the post and  non-post resources required for the backstopping of peacekeeping operations at  Headquarters, and any changes in that limitation require the prior approval of the  Assembly. The Department of Field Support and the Department of Management are  currently funded through both the regular budget and the support account. As the  resources of both departments and their associated funding sources have been  allocated on the basis of previous decisions by the Assembly, the present report  maintains the existing apportionment across funding sources for post and non-post  resources that are being drawn from the two existing departments to establish the two  new departments.  66. Once the new departments are created and they support the totality of  peacekeeping and non-peacekeeping activities of the Secretariat, the Secretary- General will submit a proposal to the General Assembly at the second part of its  seventy-fourth session to establish a clear and consistent approach to financing the  two new departments from the support account based on the initial experience gained  from the implementation of the ""whole-of-the-Secretariat"" approach.             A/72/492/Add.2    21/246  18-04386      VI. Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance         A. Office of the Under-Secretary-General      67.

The Organizational Learning, Performance Management and Staff Development  Section will put in place an Organization-wide framework to develop staff talent  throughout the entire employee life cycle, including onboarding, learning,  performance management and career development. It will nurture a culture of  engagement, leadership and results, based on the United Nations system leadership  framework and organizational values and competencies. Through Organization-wide  change initiatives, the team will support ongoing reform and transformation,  responding to input from staff and strategic and operational priorities. The team will  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  32/246    support staff performance through a robust performance management system that will  be linked to organizational objectives and that will engage staff and managers in  carefully planning, evaluating and improving performance. It will provide tools for  recognizing strong performance, providing honest feedback and constructively  addressing underperformance. The team will also build a strong foundation of  multilingualism and core competence, ensuring that staff continuously develop and  maintain the skills and knowledge they need to deliver results. Through leadership  assessment and development programmes, the team will ensure that the Organization  builds a strong pool of leaders that demonstrate a high level of ethics and integrity  and a focus on results. The team will also provide a set of resources and tools to help  staff set career objectives so that they can continuously move forward on their career  paths.        Administrative Law Division    124. The Administrative Law Division will provide client-focused strategic, policy  and legal expertise and guidance for all aspects of human resources application within  the internal justice system, on behalf of the Secretary-General, and an integrated  approach to the implementation of the United Nations standards of conduct for all  categories of personnel serving throughout the Secretariat.   125. The Division will manage administrative appeals for human resources matters  and regularly provide input to the Global Strategy and Policy Division to update  human resources policies on the basis of lessons learned from jurisprudence and  informally resolved matters. The Division will also serve as an integrated solution  with respect to the implementation of United Nations standards of conduct for all  categories of personnel serving throughout the Secretariat by:    * Overseeing and coordinating actions required to address disciplinary cases for  staff and non-staff personnel, including those deployed in the United Nations by  Member States    * Overseeing and coordinating preventive efforts, including comprehensive risk  management, as well as accountability mechanisms, for all categories of  personnel    * Providing a rapid and Secretariat-wide coordinated response to address critical  issues that affect the welfare and safety of personnel, serious reputational risks  and/or other risks adversely impacting the Organization's core values and norms  (""critical incidents"")    * Building capacities among Secretariat entities to promote and enforce the  United Nations standards of conduct    * Interacting with departments and offices, including all those with a field  presence, to support delegated decision-making processes and strengthened  internal accountability functions, building-related capacities and interacting  with Member States in the exercise of their accountability functions     * Reporting to intergovernmental and expert bodies, including the General  Assembly, about its work  126. Incorporated within the Division are the following functional areas, which  support the overall goals of the Division: the Appeals Management Section; the  Conduct and Discipline Service; and the Critical Incident Response Service.        Appeals Management Section    127. The Appeals Management Section will represent the Secretary-General before  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal on appeals against administrative decisions. This    A/72/492/Add.2    33/246  18-04386    will include filing written submissions on legal and factual issues, reviewing written  submissions from staff members that filed the cases and appearing at case  management discussions and hearings on the merits. The team will also provide legal  advice and guidance on internal justice matters to offices and departments that are  impacted, including those with field presences, both prior to a matter being before the  Dispute Tribunal (in conjunction with Management Evaluation Unit and/or the  Department of Operational Support) and once a matter is pending before the Dispute  Tribunal. Lessons learned from jurisprudence will be collated and fed back to the  Global Strategy and Policy Division and the Department of Operational Support.         Conduct and Discipline Service    128. The Conduct and Discipline Service will develop and carry out programmes in  support of the Division's policy, strategic and legislated responsibilities in connection  with the application of the United Nations standards of conduct. The Service will  ensure that these standards are effectively harmonized and applicable to all categories  of United Nations personnel, including personnel deployed by Member States. The  Service will, together with partners, lead the development and monitor the  implementation of conduct and discipline policies, procedures and guidelines, taking  into account applicable accountability frameworks, and identify best practices to  facilitate compliance with conduct and discipline standards by personnel deployed  with the United Nations by Member States.   129. The Service will adopt an integrated approach in providing global oversight of  the application of the United Nations standards of conduct for all categories of United  Nations personnel. It will interact directly with officials throughout the Secretariat  with delegated authority to address conduct issues, as well as with Member States in  the exercise of their authority to address conduct issues.   130. Through the Service, the Division will continue to manage and oversee the  misconduct tracking system that is in place for peace operations, which is used for data  analysis, case management and reporting, including through its public website, and will  progressively deploy this system to the entire Secretariat. It will also continue to vet  United Nations personnel against a history of prior misconduct while in the service of  the United Nations and work to expand this vetting function to all Secretariat  appointments and personnel. Together with partners in learning and training, the Service  will develop training programmes on upholding United Nations standards of conduct,  including with regard to sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual and workplace  harassment and fraud, in order to further strengthen transparency and accountability.   131. The Division will also develop and implement policies and advisory support in  the areas of communication, outreach and awareness-raising strategies with public  information partners; enforcement mechanisms, together with Member States and  relevant stakeholders; and remedial action.   132. The Administrative Law Division will also manage all disciplinary matters  involving United Nations staff Secretariat-wide and will represent the Secretary- General before the Dispute Tribunal in relation to challenges of disciplinary  decisions. Through this function, the Division will gather and provide feedback on  lessons learned from the conduct of disciplinary processes and/or disciplinary matters  before the Dispute Tribunal. With regard to disciplinary matters falling under the  jurisdiction of Member States, the Division will ensure that required actions are taken  as appropriate and that information is provided to the Secretariat on the actions taken.         Critical Incident Response Service    133. Effective coordination and capacity-building will be critical to ensure that the  standards of conduct are fully integrated and consistently understood and applied  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  34/246    across the Secretariat. Regular functional briefings will be provided to heads of  departments and offices, including regional commissions and offices away from  Headquarters, with particular emphasis on consultation with and updates for  departments with field presences, such as the Department of Peace Operations, the  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Political  and Peacebuilding Affairs, with regard to issues related to conduct and discipline as  may arise in the activities overseen by those departments.   134. The integration of the conduct and discipline function to cover the entire  Secretariat and to account for all categories of personnel will require dedicated and  ongoing efforts to strengthen capacities in all offices and departments, including those  with field presences. The Division will contribute to the development of a network of  conduct and discipline practitioners to enhance consistency in the application of the  standards of conduct, as well as transparency and accountability.   135. In order to ensure that the Organization is well placed to respond to emerging  issues that raise serious concerns with respect to the application and enforcement of  the standards of conduct, the Division will develop procedures and capacities to  provide a flexible, rapid, comprehensive and coordinated response to critical  incidents related to the implementation of the United Nations standards of conduct.  This specialized team will respond to complex and critical cases and/or areas of  significant risk, including by building capacities for critical incident response, as well  as contributing directly to incident management as needed. The nature of such  incident management may include taking actions to limit and mitigate damage to  individuals and the Organization and review and strengthen risk management  measures. This function will enable the Organization to assess strategies to ensure  accountability and remedial action, in coordination with relevant stakeholders,  including the Ethics Office, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and other  investigating entities, the Department of Safety and Security and, in consultation with  the Office of Legal Affairs, national authorities.   136. Another aspect of critical incident management is the ongoing implementation  of Security Council resolution 2272 (2016), as expanded upon by General Assembly  in its resolution 71/278, with regard to the repatriation of military or police units when  there is credible evidence of widespread or systemic sexual exploitation and abuse by  those units. An internal Secretariat committee has been established, led by the Under- Secretary-General for Field Support to address this matter. The Conduct and  Discipline Unit of the Department of Field Support currently serves as secretariat for  the committee; in the future, the coordination, capacity-building and incident  management function in the Administrative Law Division will perform this role.  Under the new structure, the functions of the Chair will be exercised by the Under- Secretary-General for Peace Operations, and the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will serve as a member of the  committee.   137. The functions of the Division will also include the management of the trust fund  in support of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, in response to the significant  impact of critical incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse. This will include  management of the programme of assistance to victims and coordination with the  Secretariat and inter-agency partners on assistance to victims.         D. Business Transformation and Accountability Division       138. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division is integral to the  Secretary-General's vision of a transformation of the Organization, based on sound  management principles, to make the United Nations more nimble, effective, efficient,    A/72/492/Add.2    35/246  18-04386    transparent and accountable. The Division will facilitate continuous learning and  improvement. It will house in one entity all the functions dedicated to monitoring and  strengthening performance and accountability, which will enable a more holistic view  of performance and constant feedback for lessons learned.   139. By mainstreaming results-based management and enterprise risk management  in the planning and daily operations of the Secretariat, the Division will help  managers clarify and communicate the results to be achieved and the risks to be  managed. It will support programme managers in their efforts to establish clear targets  and criteria for programme performance and will generate, analyse and communicate  data, conduct reviews and support self-evaluations. It will provide support to  programme managers in their monitoring, assessment and reporting of programme  performance. Such performance-related information and lessons learned will, in turn,  contribute to future planning. Programme performance will be reported in the  programme budget and peacekeeping budget documents and reflected on dashboards.  140. The Division will be the key enabler of the Secretary-General's proposal to  delegate authority closer to the point of delivery, by providing the guidance required  by programme managers to exercise their enhanced delegation of authority. With  support from the Division, managers will be empowered to determine how best to use  their resources to implement mandates. The Division, in cooperation with the  Department of Operational Support, will monitor how managers exercise the  authority. Where problems are detected, the Division will investigate the cause and  recommend additional support, corrective actions or, if necessary, recommend  withdrawal of the delegated authority. When such withdrawal occurs, the Division  will work with the Department of Operational Support on the measures deemed  necessary to enable its reissuance.  141. In addition to these performance- and compliance-related functions, the  Division will continually seek opportunities to modernize and innovate and will play  a project management role for large business transformation projects. It will also carry  out responsibilities in the area of business continuity and organizational resilience. It  will comprise three functional pillars: accountability systems; monitoring and  evaluation; and analytics and project management.  142. The secretariats of the Advisory Committee on Procurement and the Property  Survey Board and of the Vendor Review Committee will also be located in the  Business Transformation and Accountability Division and will report to the Director.        Accountability Systems Service    143. The Accountability Systems Service will be responsible for mainstreaming two  critical systems of accountability: results-based management, including the setting of  organizational targets and results to be achieved, and enterprise risk management,  which entails the management of risks that threaten the achievement of the desired  results. It will also analyse oversight body recommendations, reflect the findings in  policies and future planning exercises and hold managers accountable for the  implementation of oversight body recommendations.  144. The Results-based Management Section will be responsible for mainstreaming  the results-based approach by advising and supporting Secretariat departments,  offices and missions to ensure full implementation. It will develop, maintain and  update standards, policies and procedures for results-based management; coordinate  and standardize guidelines and training materials to ensure a cohesive approach to  results-based management concepts throughout the Organization; and conduct  training. It will support the implementation of the results-based management action  plan. The team, in close consultation with the Office of Finance and Budget, will  support departments, offices and missions in preparing the annual framework of  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  36/246    targets and deliverables that managers and the Secretariat as a whole will be held  accountable for achieving. The team will conduct macro-level organizational  planning to assist in the preparation of the plan outline covering the longer-term  objectives of the Organization to ensure an integrated, holistic and strategic approach  to the work of the Organization.   145. The Enterprise Risk Management Section will work with all departments,  offices and field missions to take a systematic and holistic approach to identifying,  assessing, evaluating, prioritizing, managing and controlling risk across the  Organization in order to increase the likelihood that it will achieve its objectives. In  line with the Secretary-General's vision for shifting the management paradigm, the  team will work to ensure that the simplified policy framework and the strengthened  delegation of authority and accountability frameworks are managed within a risk  management approach that balances operational and managerial risks. Managers and  staff at all levels are responsible for identifying and managing risks to the  achievement of their objectives, and the Organization will use risk assessments to  identify weaknesses in its internal controls. The team will conduct Secretariat-wide  risk assessments to identify cross-cutting risks that require a corporate response, and  it will assist in the conduct of project-specific risk assessments and the development  of mitigation strategies for business transformation projects. It will also report  regularly to the Management Committee, which serves as the risk committee for the  Secretariat. Enterprise risk management is an inherent core responsibility of  management. According to the ""three lines of defence"" model, it is essential that risk  management become part of the Organization's ""DNA"" and that managers consider  risks and their potential impact on their ability to achieve strategic and operational  objectives on an ongoing basis as part of their day-to-day core functions. It will be  the responsibility of the team to support them in this process.  146. The Oversight Coordination Section will serve as the Secretariat's central focal  point for engagement with the following oversight bodies: the Board of Auditors, the  Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent  Audit Advisory Committee. The team will review the findings and recommendations  of the oversight bodies to identify material weaknesses and reportable conditions. As  accountability for implementing oversight body recommendations will be delegated  to programme managers, the team will track rates of implementation and provide  quarterly reports on implementation and related issues to the Management  Committee, noting where action is not being taken or where a Secretariat-wide  response is required. It will draft related reports of the Secretary-General to the  General Assembly. Its findings and lessons learned will inform policies, future  planning, performance assessments and decisions related to accountability.  147. As focal point for the Joint Inspection Unit, the team will submit reports to the  Department for General Assembly and Conference Management for issuance as General  Assembly documents and prepare consolidated comments of the Secretary-General to  CEB regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Unit. It will also  review and monitor investigation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services  jointly with the Office of Human Resources. In addition, it will review and make  recommendations regarding requests for exception to the standards of accommodation  for air travel and will report thereon to the advisory and legislative bodies.        Monitoring and Evaluation Service    148. The Monitoring and Evaluation Service will be responsible for managing  delegation of authority, monitoring and reporting on organizational performance and  developing self-evaluation tools for use across the Secretariat.    A/72/492/Add.2    37/246  18-04386    149. A cornerstone of changing the management paradigm is the Secretary-General's  intention to delegate authority to managers as close to the point of delivery as  possible. While extensive delegations are envisaged, the capacity to support the  responsible exercise of the authority by managers must be in place, and the  Organization will closely monitor how the delegations are used, provide guidance to  managers and, where necessary, provide additional support or take corrective action.   150. The team responsible for managing the delegation of authority, which will be  issued on a functional rather than a personal basis, will produce a consolidated policy  document which clearly sets out delegations of authority and will maintain official  and updated records. The Monitoring of Delegation of Authority Section will work  with the Department of Operational Support to assist managers who have been  delegated authority to ensure that they understand what is expected of them and the  parameters of the authority. The team will be staffed with experts in the various  functional areas. In this way, it will play a preventive role. It will also assist  programme managers through the development of policies and procedures that will  govern all delegations of authority, taking into consideration the Organization's  objectives and structure.  151. In addition, the team will monitor the use of delegated authority on an ongoing  basis to ensure that managers and staff are managing and balancing operational and  managerial risk, complying with regulations and rules and using delegations  effectively as they implement their mandates. Procedures for monitoring and  oversight of the authority delegated, as well as criteria for the withdrawal of the  delegated authority and other corrective actions, will be developed. Monitoring will  be conducted through data analysis, mobile team visits to offices and missions, and  other mechanisms. When, as a result of its monitoring activities, problems are  detected, the team will engage with the relevant offices/staff to ensure an  understanding of the proper protocol and to prevent future non-compliance. When  corrective action is required, the team will alert the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. Lessons learned from the monitoring  efforts will inform future decision-making and policy revisions.  152. The team will also monitor the segregation of duties across all the functional  areas within the Organization to ensure that the required degree of internal control is  maintained. It will define procedures for monitoring the system of segregation of  duties, outline possibilities for increased ICT system controls and prepare and  implement an internal monitoring schedule.  153. The team will also have a management review function and will identify  activities/areas of the Organization that require tests of compliance with relevant  regulations and rules, either at the policy level (e.g., compliance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and the Staff Regulations and Rules) or at the organizational  unit level (e.g., in a peacekeeping mission or a regional commission) and assess the  effectiveness of the internal controls in place to evaluate the level of compliance  and/or deter non-compliance.  154. The Organizational Performance Measurement Section will conduct regular and  systematic monitoring of progress towards the key indicators identified in the senior  managers' compacts. The team will also provide substantive support to the  Management Performance Board and will coordinate the senior managers' compacts  and related performance assessments. It will report the results, both at the individual  level and in aggregate, to the Management Performance Board and the Secretary- General. The results will inform decisions regarding accountability, support  continuous improvement and identify systemic weaknesses that require a corporate- level response.  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  38/246    155. Starting with the 2020 programme budget cycle, the team will analyse and  capture the main findings and trends in the performance of individual programmes,  as reflected in part II of the sections of the programme budget, and report on the main  organizational performance trends in the foreword and introduction to the programme  budget. The Section will also monitor the implementation of the programme of work  for the peacekeeping budgets. It will strengthen related practices for assessing and  reporting on programmatic performance, an area that is currently self-assessed by  managers and not independently verified. It will also provide substantive servicing to  the relevant intergovernmental meetings.  156. The Secretariat has long suffered from a lack of capacity, in terms of both  resources and expertise, for conducting proper self-evaluations of its programmes and  activities. As the ability to regularly and professionally evaluate work is essential to  effective results-based management, the Evaluation Section  will provide  methodological support and skills development to staff Secretariat-wide, help draft  terms of reference for self-evaluations, and manage and/or provide quality assurance  for self-evaluation activities on behalf of departments and offices that might require  assistance. As part of this support, the team will prepare and maintain a roster of  professional evaluators who can be hired to conduct evaluations on behalf of  departments that lack in-house expertise.   157. In direct support of results-based management, the team will support  programme managers in their efforts to take self-evaluation results and lessons  learned into consideration in the preparation of the programme budget and  peacekeeping budgets. The team will ensure that the results of self-evaluation  exercises and lessons learned are made public.        Analytics and Project Management Service    158. A primary goal of the Secretary-General's reform agenda is to ensure that the  Secretariat delivers the vital mandates entrusted to it with maximum economy,  efficiency and effectiveness. With the implementation of Umoja, the Secretariat now  has integrated performance data across the entire Organization. The Analytics and  Project Management Service will continuously mine and analyse the data from Umoja  and other enterprise systems and communicate its findings regarding patterns, trends  and areas of strength and weakness to relevant stakeholders, both internal and external  to the Secretariat. Drawing on input from accountability and compliance reviews,  external review bodies and evaluations, it will systematically identify opportunities  to modernize and transform business practices and will have a robust, standing project  management capacity to ensure that change efforts are designed, communicated and  implemented in an efficient and sustainable manner and according to best practices  in project management. This new evidence-driven change management capacity is  essential to drive the management reform forward and communicate progress and  risks to all stakeholders.  159. The Analytics Section will analyse real-time business data from Umoja and  other enterprise systems and provide trend analyses and other analytical reports, such  as dashboards, to senior management, the Management Committee, individual  departments and the legislative bodies. It will use this data to determine unit costs  and the level of efficiency of services provided and will analyse and recommend ways  to improve the quality of management services through quality assurance exercises.  The findings from these reviews and exercises will inform the development of  strategies and policies by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and decision-making by senior managers across the Secretariat,  including as related to performance and accountability.     A/72/492/Add.2    39/246  18-04386    160. The team will also identify administrative services that require quality assurance  tests and perform such tests to assess if these services and the processes they entail  meet the determined quality standards. Based on its findings, the team will prepare  quality assurance reports that will include information on the strengths and  weaknesses of the services provided, weaknesses in the processes followed for the  provision of such services and recommendations for improvement.  161. The Business Transformation and Project Management Section will help the  Organization to continuously improve and ensure that its business model is aligned  with evolving mandates and changing operational environments. It will develop and  continually refine strategies based on anticipated client needs. As the Organization is  considering and designing business transformation initiatives, it must have a long- term view and ensure that it can sustain the new way of working and that the new  practices will not be out of date within a short period of time. It will take a future- oriented approach and will ensure that transformative projects do not simply aim to  improve on what the Organization is currently doing, but find ways of doing things  differently. The team will monitor new trends, such as the effect of artificial  intelligence on the workforce, and will proactively identify opportunities to innovate.  It will keep abreast of industry best practices but will also ensure an ongoing focus  beyond existing ways of doing business.   162. The team will also play a project management role and will coordinate the  Secretariat's portfolio of major transformation projects. It will ensure that the projects  are designed, communicated and implemented according to best practices in change  management, including the training required for staff leading such projects, and that  the unique requirements of field missions are carefully considered. It will also provide  project and operations management training and guidance and, in a collaborative  effort with the Department of Operational Support, will support departments in any  structural or process changes they may need to undertake in responding to new  mandates.        Secretariat of the Advisory Committee on Procurement and the Property  Survey Board        Advisory Committee on Procurement    163. The Headquarters Committee on Contracts will become the Advisory  Committee on Procurement. The Committee will support officials to whom  procurement authority has been delegated and the Assistant Secretary-General for  Supply Chain Management in their accountable exercise of procurement authority by  providing advice on the award of contracts for goods and services. As the Committee  serves an important compliance function, it is proposed that the secretariat of the  Committee -- which currently resides within the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management -- be located within the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division to maintain the independence of the Committee and avoid  potential conflicts of interest.        Property Survey Board    164. The Headquarters Property Survey Board will become the Property Survey  Board. The Property Survey Board and local boards established in locations away  from Headquarters will provide written advice to delegated officials with respect to  the disposal of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete property, plant and equipment,  inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations, as well as with respect to the  loss, damage or impairment of such items or other discrepancies involving such items.  The Property Survey Board will advise on the causes of loss or damage to United  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  40/246    Nations property and the degree of negligence, if any, and potential financial recovery  from staff members and other officials.        Secretariat of the Vendor Review Committee    165. This team will serve as the secretariat of the Vendor Review Committee, which  is an internal body that reviews applications to the register of vendors that do not  meet the registration criteria; complaints from requisitioners and/or other United  Nations staff against vendors who were alleged to have failed to perform in  accordance with the terms and conditions of contracts awarded; and proposals for  special approval of vendors recommended by the Procurement Division.        VII. Department of Operational Support       166. Under the new management paradigm, the Department of Operational Support  exists to support the objective of effective mandate delivery, and will do so through  the provision of operational advisory services to clients, support for the  implementation of decisions and, in exceptional cases, exercise of delegated authority  on behalf of clients across the Secretariat. In addition, the Department will provide  dedicated operational support to departments and offices located at Headquarters in  New York.        A. Office of the Under-Secretary-General       167. The Under-Secretary-General will be responsible for all activities of the  Department of Operational Support. The Under-Secretary-General will co-chair the  Management Client Board jointly with the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, as reflected in paragraph 47 above.  168. The Office of the Under-Secretary-General will consist of a front office to be  established through the redeployment of the front office of the Under-Secretary- General for Field Support as well as a Performance and Analytics Section, an Audit  Response and Boards of Inquiry Section and an Environment Section.        Performance and Analytics Section    169. The Performance and Analytics Section will oversee the operational  performance of all units within the Department of Operational Support and support  decision-making by senior management using custom analytics products that will  track operational performance throughout the Secretariat. These will include the  annual global client satisfaction survey, regular reports on operational performance  and analytics support to specific initiatives, such as peacekeeping reviews. In  addition, the Section will identify opportunities for operational enhancement and  capitalize upon those opportunities, in collaboration with stakeholders, through  continuous improvement of business processes and operational guidance. Because of  the need to strengthen a data-driven approach to operationally support effective  mandate implementation, it is proposed that the Performance and Analytics Section  be established through augmentation of the existing Programme Implementation  Coordination Team in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Field Support,  with additional performance and analytics capacity redeployed from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support and the Field Personnel Division.      A/72/492/Add.2    41/246  18-04386        Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section    170. The Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section will be responsible for  coordinating, developing and preparing responses to reports of United Nations  oversight bodies for the Department of Operational Support, as well as the  Department of Peacebuilding and Political Affairs and the Department of Peace  Operations; for following up on the recommendations of boards of inquiry in the field;  and for providing administrative support to boards of inquiry convened at  Headquarters. It is proposed that this Section be established through the redeployment  of the existing Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support.        Environment Section    171. The Environment Section, which was established in the Office of the Under- Secretary-General for Field Support pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/295,  is currently responsible for supporting the implementation of the environmental  sustainability management framework in peace operations by providing operational  support, guidance and technical assistance. The Assembly, in its resolution 72/219,  endorsed the action plan for integrating sustainable development practices into  Secretariat-wide operations and facilities management. It is proposed that the Section  be moved to the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support and  to expand its scope to encompass the entire Secretariat, drawing upon the extensive  experience it has gained through its support to peacekeeping operations in the  management of environmental impact and associated risks, while continuing to  leverage the expertise of the United Nations Environment Programme.        B. Office of Support Operations      172. The Office of Support Operations will support clients through the provision of  guidance and advisory services, direct assistance where capacity may be weak or  non-existent, capacity-building, process improvements and optimization, and  operational performance reviews. The Office of Support Operations will consist of  the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service, the Human Resources  Services Division and the Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and  Health Division.        Office of the Assistant Secretary-General    173. It is proposed that the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Support  Operations be established through the redeployment of resources of the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support, given that the existing office -- by  virtue of its current role supervising the four divisions of the current Department of  Field Support -- already has a cross-functional perspective of resource management  and performance.        Capacity Development and Operational Training Service    174. The Capacity Development and Operational Training Service will assist clients  in building and improving the capacities needed to accountably exercise delegated  authority, including structures and business processes to better integrate resources,  accountability and programme delivery in line with priorities. The Service will consist  of two teams: an Operational Training Section and a Business Processes and Systems  Support Section. In addition, seven posts from the current Policy, Evaluation and  Training Division, consisting of three posts from the Knowledge Management and  Guidance Team and four posts from the Integrated Training Service, will become part  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  42/246    of the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service, but will be embedded  in the Policy, Evaluation and Training Division in the new Department of Peace  Operations.  175. The Operational Training Section will consist of 5 posts from the Field  Personnel Division and 14 posts from the Capacity Development Section of the Field  Budget and Finance Division. It will be responsible for delivering training specific to  operational support to ensure that clients have the capacities and knowledge needed  to comply with organizational standards and policies.  176. The Business Processes and Systems Support Section will be responsible for  developing the processes and structures by which policies will be implemented across  the Secretariat and will work with other stakeholders to ensure that these are reflected  in enterprise systems. It will also provide training on Inspira, Umoja and other  business applications related to resources management. The Section will provide  support across all Secretariat entities to help ensure consistency in the execution of  processes and to ensure that the processes continue to meet the requirements of all  clients. The proposed staffing of the Section is based on assumptions concerning the  number of service requests that will be received each year based on the workload for  similar functions currently performed by the Field Personnel Division of the  Department of Field Support to support field missions. In order to address gaps in  support requirements that cannot be met because of limited resources, service-level  agreements with offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and others  will be concluded to meet training requirements in this area and to make good use of  existing learning centres in those entities.        Human Resources Services Division    177. In the proposed concept, human resources functions will be divided between the  new departments, with strategy, policy and compliance to be located in the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and all operational  support to be located in the Department of Operational Support. The Human  Resources Services Division in the Office of Support Operations will focus on short- to medium-term human resources requirements of clients, from process development  through service delivery, with the aim of avoiding the delays and redundancies that  currently exist.        Staffing Service    178. The Staffing Service, which will be established through the consolidation of  staffing functions in the Field Personnel Division of the Department of Field Support  and the Strategic Planning and Staffing Division of the Office of Human Resources  Management, will provide expertise and develop processes in the areas of staffing,  testing and examinations, operational workforce planning and organizational design  and management across entities. This will facilitate a holistic approach to operational  workforce planning with client entities during budget cycles. The integrated approach  will enable the Service to provide guidance on organizational design and staffing  structures in the context of the planning process for new entities and entities in  transition, review staffing against models and benchmarks on a regular basis and link  the operational and evolving needs of clients with staffing programmes to anticipate  vacancies and required skills/potential applicants, while ensuring consistency across  all supported entities.  179. The Service will, inter alia, develop recruitment processes for entities with  delegated authority; facilitate recruitment for entities without delegated authority;  manage rosters across all job families; ensure an integrated approach to the use of the  various staffing modalities available within the Secretariat, such as job openings,    A/72/492/Add.2    43/246  18-04386    generic job openings and recruitment from rosters; develop tools and processes to  help entities meet targets related to the effectiveness and efficiency of the recruitment  process, including with regard to gender, geographical and troop- and police- contributing country representation; develop staffing models and procedures for rapid  deployment, start-up and crisis situations; administer the young professionals  programme and the managed reassignment programme; manage the submission of  positions to the Senior Review Group and subsequent approval by the Secretary- General; advise client entities with regard to organizational design and staffing  structures; and provide guidance in the application of standards of classification and  organization management for newly established or changing functions.  180. The proposed level of staffing for the Service resulting from the consolidation  of staffing functions currently split between two departments, when combined with  simplified policies and processes, will allow the Service to better handle its heavy  workload, particularly in the area of roster management. At its current level of  staffing, the Field Personnel Division is able to refresh only 30 to 40 of the 450 rosters  each year. The proposed level of staffing will allow for additional generic job  openings to be managed each year, providing more opportunities for internal and  external candidates alike to be rostered, particularly in job families with evolving  requirements or where the number of candidates is insufficient, and ensuring focus  on gender and geographic distribution.        Operational Support and Advisory Service    181. The Operational Support and Advisory Service will serve as a primary entry  point and point of contact for clients for services not within the scope of the global  service delivery model and the shared service centres. The Service will provide the  full spectrum of consistent, standard and timely advisory services to senior managers  in the exercise of their delegated authorities. When clients require advice on the  exercise of their delegated authority, their business partners will be their first point of  contact. The advisory capacities within the Department of Operational Support will  serve as a resource for business partners. For cases requiring exceptional policy  clarification, the Department of Operational Support will seek the guidance of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   182. For those transactional services within the scope of the global service delivery  model, the primary entry point for clients will be the shared service centres. The  Operational Support and Advisory Service will also help identify capacity-building  requirements to strengthen the ability of entities to exercise delegated authority.  Furthermore, the Service will provide dedicated advice to managers on the application  of policies and processes in consultation with local business partners. Such advice  will reduce the likelihood of mistakes in administrative decisions that could lead to  cases under the formal and informal system of administration of justice. With the  provision of consistent, clear advice relevant to the specific context of client entities,  managers will be able to make better and faster decisions, thereby allowing them to  devote more time to programme and mandate delivery and to meeting the expectations  of Member States.   183. Services to be provided by the Operational Support and Advisory Service  include advice on the implementation of the Staff Regulations and Rules and policies,  including on the authority delegated to clients; guidance and support in the  development of entity-specific human resources strategies and associated  implementation plans, where requested; analysis of client performance to identify  requirements for human resources capacity-building; feedback on and identification  of requirements for continuous process improvements and adaptation to policies and  processes based on operational requirements and trends; support to managers related  to formal and informal conflict resolution, including advice to clients related to the  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  44/246    formal and informal system of administration of justice; support for transactional  services delivered by shared service centres; and assistance in the development of  recruitment strategies and plans. Operational trends and requirements will be fed back  into the review by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  of policies, the Staff Rules and the regulatory framework. In addition, the advice to  clients will help identify capacity-building requirements and areas where further  simplification or additional policies are required for the field.        Non-Staff Capacities Unit    184. A dedicated Non-Staff Capacities Unit will provide support to managers and  business partners in the use of non-staff personnel, such as consultants, government- provided personnel and United Nations Volunteers, to ensure compliance with the  relevant General Assembly resolutions. The dedicated unit will help clients to obtain  the capacities necessary to deliver their mandates, while ensuring adherence to the  policies and procedures applicable to the use of non-staff capacities. The proposed  level of staffing is required because while the use of non-staff personnel has increased  in recent years, no dedicated capacity currently exists for this function. A dedicated  capacity will also facilitate better coordination with Member States on issues related  to personnel contributed by their Governments under the non-staff modality and  ensure that such capacities are established in accordance with the mandates of the  General Assembly.        Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health Division    185. The responsibility for occupational safety and health is currently spread across  multiple departments within the Secretariat. The resulting lack of clarity in the  division of responsibilities affects the critical functions of health service  management, occupational safety and provision of medical support. The current  fragmentation can be addressed by combining existing operational capacities into an  integrated capacity within the Department of Operational Support. It is therefore  proposed to establish a Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health  Division through the consolidation of the existing Medical Services Division in the  Office of Human Resources Management in the Department of Management and  related functions currently shared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and  the Department of Field Support, namely, the Field Occupational Safety and Risk  Management Officer in the Office of the Chief of Staff and the HIV/AIDS Unit in the  Policy, Evaluation and Training Division.   186. The Division, which will be led by a director, will be consist of two main  functional areas: occupational safety and health and health systems administration.  The occupational safety and health component, which will be overseen by the Deputy  Director of the Division, will be responsible for occupational safety; occupational  health, including clinical services, travel medicine and health promotion; mental  health and well-being; and medical emergency response. This component will work  closely with the Department of Safety and Security in areas of common concern,  including critical incident stress management. The health systems administration  component, which will be overseen directly by the Director of the Division, will be  responsible for clinical standards and oversight, including hospital assessments;  health workforce management, including credentialing; and technical review of  compensation claims from uniformed personnel.        C. Office of Supply Chain Management      187. The Office of Supply Chain Management will bring together the logistics and  procurement capabilities currently in the Department of Field Support and the    A/72/492/Add.2    45/246  18-04386    Department of Management to create a single entity to manage the integrated end-to- end supply chain. The current provision of support and services to clients is reactive  and fragmented, with multiple interdepartmental handover points, which contributes  to delays in the delivery of goods and services. In line with the introduction of supply  chain management in the Department of Field Support and the related restructuring  of the Logistics Support Division, as approved by the General Assembly in its  resolution 71/295, this approach will be enhanced by consolidating procurement,  logistics and enabling functions under a single management, with the aim of providing  more agile, responsive, efficient and effective client-oriented services. Key planning  functions will include anticipating client requirements through demand planning and  forecasting; identifying appropriate sourcing options through global source planning  utilizing relevant logistics and procurement expertise; and planning, consolidating  and contracting freight and passenger services for delivery at the right time to the  right place. The strengthening and modernizing of the technical and commercial  aspects of the sourcing process through category management will be at the core of  ensuring that clients receive the right goods and services of the right quality for the  right cost in the right quantity and at the right time.   188. The aim of the alignment of procurement and logistics with an end-to-end  supply chain approach is to strengthen collaboration and seamless coordination  between the two functions, while maintaining the fundamental principles of public  procurement, including best value for money; fairness, integrity and transparency;  effective international competition; and the interest of the Organization. While  providing timely, effective and efficient services to clients, the Office will also ensure  the maintenance of effective checks and balances and the segregation of  responsibilities with respect to the commercial and technical aspects of the sourcing  process and ensure good stewardship over public funding.  189. The proposed structure also builds on measures taken since 2008 to address the  requirements of field missions, such as the establishment of the global high-value  contracts essential for mission operations; enhancement of accountability and the  delegation of authority, while strengthening internal control mechanisms; improved  sourcing, including further enhancement of business opportunities for vendors from  developing countries and countries with economies in transition; improved  information technology systems; comprehensive training programmes; and the  introduction of a compliance monitoring programme. The success of the compliance  monitoring programme in missions was acknowledged in 2013 by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services, which recommended that the programme be expanded to  include offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and tribunals.  190. The Office of Supply Chain Management will encompass the Logistics  Division, the Procurement Division, the Uniformed Capabilities Support Division and  the Enabling Section, which will support operations through the provision of  operational reporting, business intelligence, vendor outreach and performance  management, as well as through the establishment of baselines and the monitoring of  key performance indicators. The Uniformed Capabilities Support Division will  consolidate the functions currently split between the Department of Field Support and  the Department of Management that support the generation, deployment and  reimbursement of formed military and police units to United Nations peace  operations.   191. The Office will implement the supply chain management blueprint first  promulgated by the Department of Field Support in October 2016 and updated in  December 2017 in consultation with the Department of Management as a key strategic  partner. The blueprint includes integrated end-to-end supply chain management  processes with clearly defined functions, roles and responsibilities; offers different  supply chain solutions for different situations, requirements and challenges; provides  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  46/246    infrastructure, technology and resource solutions, including human resources  solutions and the skills necessary to support and enable the supply chain management  processes; and includes a strong performance management framework to measure,  monitor and manage the supply chain to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The  blueprint will continue to be updated in order to reflect changes and refinements,  taking into account lessons learned, feedback from clients, global best practices and  recommendations by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and oversight bodies.  192. The Office of Supply Chain Management will introduce category management,  in which both technical and commercial teams will work closely to improve the  sourcing process but retain their respective functional reporting lines to ensure  segregation of duties. Category management is the cross-functional management of  goods and services throughout their life cycles, including the gathering of  requirements, sourcing, deployment and disposal, taking into consideration the total  cost of ownership and optimizing long-term value for the Organization.   193. The operational aspects of the integrated supply chain will be enabled by Umoja  Extension 2, which will provide new capabilities for demand planning, supply  network planning, transportation management, and tracking and tracing. With the  deployment of these four supply chain modules under Extension 2, the Organization  will have the visibility over the various process stages necessary to efficiently and  effectively manage the end-to-end supply chain and report on its performance.  Furthermore, accountability and the segregation of duties will be supported through  the assignment of transactional roles.        Office of the Assistant Secretary-General    194. The Assistant Secretary-General will be responsible for all of the activities of  the Office of Supply Chain Management and its administration and management. The  Assistant Secretary-General will provide leadership and direction relating to the  implementation and coordination of the organizational entities which together form  the Organization's integrated supply chain and uniformed capabilities support.   195. The proposed integrated supply chain management approach will allow the  Organization to deliver well-managed and agile solutions to all clients and be more  proactive by planning globally based on consolidated requirements and will provide  better visibility of operational needs.   196. It is proposed that the new Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Supply  Chain Management be created from the existing Office of the Assistant Secretary- General for Central Support Services.        Aviation Safety Team    197. The Aviation Safety Team, which consists of aviation safety experts reporting  directly to the Assistant Secretary-General, will oversee all matters related to United  Nations aviation operations, including aircraft utilized for personnel and cargo  movements and the official travel of staff. The Team will set standards, processes and  procedures for aviation safety in line with international standards and United Nations  requirements, monitor safety in operations, assess safety risks and conduct safety  assurance activities. The Team will also provide technical oversight for aviation  safety staff in field missions and be responsible for capacity-building through training  and awareness-raising. As part of its responsibilities, the Team will support sourcing  of United Nations aviation service vendors and liaise with national authorities, troop- contributing countries and partner organizations.      A/72/492/Add.2    47/246  18-04386        Enabling Section    198. The Enabling Section will report directly to the Assistant Secretary-General and  provide a single set of performance management metrics, reporting and guidance to  serve the technical and commercial interests of the Office and its clients. The  Enabling Section will establish a performance management framework, including  baseline business intelligence, operational reporting and key performance indicators  to measure the overall health of supply chain management; review supply chain  performance to advise senior management on challenges, achievements and the  identification of further enhancements; assist with vendor registration and outreach  programmes through the organization of dedicated, multi-agency business seminars  with a strong focus on the least developed and developing countries; and develop  operational guidance and best practices on supply chain management for all clients.        Logistics Division    199. The Logistics Division will perform a central role in the implementation of end- to-end supply chain management. It will provide direction and advice on logistical  matters, monitor and assess the delivery of strategic transportation and support  services and direct the delivery of transportation and specialist support services in the  functional areas of air transport, ground transport, engineering, medical and supply,  inclusive of fuel, rations and general supplies and security equipment. The Division  will also perform and lead global integrated supply chain planning functions to  facilitate global demand, source and delivery planning across all technical areas  within its functional scope. The Division will consist of a Supply Chain Planning  Service, a Sourcing Support Service, an Air Transport Service and a Movement  Control Section.        Office of the Director    200. The Office of the Director will provide leadership and direction to the various  services, sections and units within the Division and effective coordination with clients  and other interlocutors and stakeholders. The Office of the Director will be  responsible for providing overall advice and guidance on logistical matters and  monitoring and assessing the delivery of strategic transportation and support services.  The Office will be responsible for supervising the functions of all services and  sections within the Division to ensure the timely provision of logistics support to all  clients through the timely development of global plans for demand, source planning  and delivery; ensuring that category managers are working closely with clients to  provide customized solutions; and ensuring that the technical specifications of  specialist needs of the clients are comprehensive and properly defined and that clients,  including Member States, in particular troop- and police contributing countries, are  provided with timely advice and support, including on the transport of dangerous  goods during deployment of contingents to the field missions.        Supply Chain Planning Service    201. The Supply Chain Planning Service will be responsible for developing and  managing a global plan for demand forecasting, source planning and delivery through  the identification and assessment of the needs of all clients across all Secretariat  entities. The responsibilities of the Service will include, inter alia, establishing and  planning for global, consolidated requirements for all clients; developing a long-term  plan to facilitate forecasting, source planning and delivery; continuously reviewing  and updating medium-term plans to meet client-specific needs; and facilitating  provisions for contingencies. While developing source plans, the Service will work  closely with the Procurement Division to determine the most appropriate sourcing  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  48/246    options, including alternative acquisition methods if they are in the Organization's  best interest, such as letters of assist and cooperation with or use of other United  Nations entities.   202. The Service will be established from the planning functions currently located in  the Supply Chain Planning and Enabling Service of the Logistics Support Division  and will be organized into four teams: the Office of the Chief of Service, the Demand  Planning Section, the Source Planning Section and the Delivery Planning Section.        Sourcing Support Service    203. The Strategic Support Service of the Logistics Support Division, as restructured  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/295, will become the Sourcing  Support Service. The Chief of the Service will provide senior-level professional,  technical and operational knowledge to all clients, with a focus on conducting a full  range of activities in support of operations in the portfolio areas of medical support,  engineering, rations, fuel, ground transportation, general supplies and security  equipment. The Service will work in partnership with the Procurement Division to  establish systems contracts that best serve the interests of all clients for the relevant  portfolios.  204. In implementing an end-to-end supply chain, the Service will adopt a category  management strategy jointly with the Procurement Division to benefit from the  combined technical and commercial expertise available. A holistic approach will be  taken to the acquisition process, with access to market intelligence, close liaison and  communication with clients and the ability to leverage the latest technologies to adopt  innovative approaches to providing effective and efficient support to all clients.  Furthermore, the adoption of a category management approach and improved  specifications and source planning will reduce risk in the supply chain and increase  overall value in the delivery of goods and services because the Service will be fully  informed of market trends and technological innovations.        Movement Control Section    205. The Movement Control Section, which will be transferred from the Logistics  Support Division, will continue to provide for the strategic air lift of military and  police personnel and contingent-owned equipment and will provide advice to troop-  and police-contributing countries on the movement of their contingents and the  readiness of cargo, including the movement of dangerous goods. With the  establishment of a strong delivery planning capacity, the Section's role will be  expanded to include the movement of United Nations-owned equipment. The  Movement Control Section will also be responsible for establishing global, regional  and country-specific (where necessary) freight-forwarding and other transportation- related contracts for United Nations equipment.        Air Transport Service    206. There will be no change in the functions and responsibilities of the Air Transport  Service. The Service will continue to provide aviation support, including for  unmanned aerial systems, to all Secretariat entities through the timely establishment  of the required contracts, in coordination with the Procurement Division, and will  provide management support to all clients to enhance cost-effectiveness and  efficiency of aviation operations. As approved by the General Assembly in its  resolution 71/294, the Strategic Air Operations Centre will continue to report to the  Chief of the Air Transport Service. The Service will be responsible for providing  aviation sourcing support, including for unmanned aerial systems, by developing  technical specifications, statements of requirements, modalities of long-term versus    A/72/492/Add.2    49/246  18-04386    short-term sourcing and letters of assist versus commercial sourcing, along with  contracting and invitations to bid versus requests for proposals, to ensure that clients'  needs are met with the most appropriate services in the most cost-effective and  efficient manner. The Service will also be responsible for improving the management  and operations of United Nations aviation support, including by determining aviation  requirements, analysing spending and utilization, and exploring new ways of  fulfilling client requirements, including through standby arrangements and sharing  within the Secretariat. This will be achieved through the provision of guidance to  ensure the right configuration of air assets, infrastructure and services in order to  facilitate the execution of mandated tasks, while ensuring that contracted services  comply with the requirements of the United Nations and the International Civil  Aviation Organization Standards and Recommended Practices. The Service will also  provide dedicated air transportation support during the start-up, sustainment,  transition and liquidation phases of missions; facilitate the planning and  implementation of training courses, workshops and seminars for the development of  aviation specialists; and establish operational guidance to support the effective and  efficient delivery of capabilities from both commercial providers and Member States.   207. The Service will work closely with the Supply Chain Planning Service to  identify client requirements, coordinate with the Procurement Division to ensure that  requirements are properly met and to jointly negotiate with Member States on letters  of assist, and engage with client entities to ensure that the Service effectively and  efficiently meets their requirements.        Procurement Division    208. The Procurement Division will perform a key role in the implementation of end- to-end supply chain management. The current Procurement Division will be  integrated into the Office of Supply Chain Management, together with the Logistics  Division, to enable a faster, less fragmented and more responsive acquisition process  and to enhance communication with clients and stakeholders. The alignment with the  Logistics Division will promote holistic client orientation and the delivering of results  as a team. Closer collaboration in the planning stage will also allow visibility with  respect to client requirements from the beginning.  209. Bringing together the procurement and logistics sourcing functions into the  same Department and Office will improve and strengthen cooperation between areas  of technical and commercial expertise to provide more agile and effective support to  clients, with the necessary safeguards to maintain segregation of duties,  accountability and risk levels. Core procurement functions, such as solicitation  exercises, commercial evaluations, recommendations of qualified offers and contract  administration, will remain independent of the requisitioners to ensure compliance  with the Financial Regulations and Rules and associated internal controls. Each  person's roles will be clearly mapped in Umoja in line with his or her respective  responsibilities in order to help ensure transparency, segregation of duties and  accountability in procurement.  210. A judicious balance will be found between centralized procurement --  benefiting from improved planning, sophisticated technical and commercial expertise  and economies of scale -- and decentralized procurement to enable greater agility on  the part of the clients. Complex and/or strategic goods and services will be procured  centrally, based on requirements, including specifications and statements of work  developed by the Sourcing Support Service in the Logistics Division. Requirements  that are more appropriately sourced locally or regionally, primarily involving low- value procurement, will be procured by the client entities themselves.   A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  50/246    211. Recognizing the importance of enabling integrated and holistic procurement  support that serves the needs of the Secretariat-wide entities, the Procurement  Division will work closely with the Logistics Division to ensure high-quality and  timely services to all Secretariat clients. The Procurement Division, together with the  Logistics Division, will also actively support start-up missions and offices, surge  requirements and humanitarian emergencies through the provision of relevant  expertise, where needed, and the expedited sourcing and delivery of appropriate  goods and services. The two divisions will exercise delegated authority in their areas  of expertise in such cases.   212. The procurement function will consist of the former procurement functions in  the Office of Central Support Services. The procurement functions will be  reorganized to align directly with the category management approach to be  implemented jointly by the Logistics Division and the Procurement Division. Based  on the category management approach, the Procurement Division will ensure  optimized acquisition of key requirements for the Organization. The category  management concept will allow a maximization of economies of scale and provide a  uniform and consolidated acquisition strategy carried out by procurement  professionals who have the required expertise. It will also allow for the enhanced  provision of procurement services to the field and for other clients. Procurement will  continue to be conducted by experienced and qualified procurement staff throughout  the global Secretariat.  213. While most of the high-value, complex and risk-prone procurement will  continue to be conducted through the central procurement function, local offices will  be given the necessary authority and capacity to conduct less complex, time-sensitive,  primarily low-value procurement at the point of delivery. The benefits include quicker  delivery, availability of off-the-shelf spare parts and local maintenance and  simplification of the processes for local requirements, such as leases and utilities.  Individual managers will be held directly accountable for decisions taken. The  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will monitor  performance and adherence to applicable policies, the Financial Regulations and  Rules and the overarching principles of best value for money, fairness, transparency,  integrity and the interest of the Organization. Umoja will provide a robust audit trail  by documenting many of the procurement process steps. Finally, a stringent risk  management framework will be put in place to avoid or mitigate financial, operational  and reputational risks.        Office of the Director    214. The Office of the Director will provide leadership and direction to the various  services, sections and units within the Division and effective coordination with clients  and other interlocutors.  215. The Office of the Director will be responsible for providing overall advice and  guidance on procurement matters, within the Office of Supply Chain Management  and the Department of Operational Support and to smaller procurement offices  worldwide. The Office will be responsible for ensuring that the principles of  procurement are reflected in day-to-day procedures and practices and that proper  internal controls are established at all levels of the Division and for identifying the  levels of risk (operational, financial and fraud). The Office will be responsible for  supervising the functions of all units within the Division to ensure that timely  procurement support is provided for all clients. The Office will also provide support  to all units on complex, innovative projects and projects that include the collaborative  engagement of other United Nations entities.     A/72/492/Add.2    51/246  18-04386    216. In addition, the Office of the Director will provide information to the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance on operational issues  and challenges associated with policy issues and will implement policy guidance from  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance in day-to-day  procurement operations. The Office of the Director will liaise with Member States, as  appropriate, on procurement matters and with the Procurement Network of the High- level Committee on Management to identify procurement synergies with other United  Nations entities.        Aviation, Major Commodities and Regional Service    217. Given the importance of providing client-oriented services for complex, high- value and strategic acquisitions, this Service will use a category management  approach to meet the procurement needs of Secretariat-wide entities in the following  categories: air, road and sea charter; various other aviation-related requirements;  global freight forwarding and logistics services; and turnkey contracts covering food,  fuel, pharmaceuticals, vehicles and other relevant strategic items. The Service will  also provide field-focused support, which will include, but not be limited to, agile  standby resources to expedite procurement for new and expanding missions, and will  leverage the local and regional networks of suppliers in support of various entities.        Real Estate, Information Technology and Corporate Service    218. Using a category management approach, this Service will provide global  procurement services in the following categories: ICT; real estate/construction  projects and infrastructure/engineering services; corporate services, including  consultancies; and critical financial services. This will include the procurement of  global ICT requirements in support of all entities at the local, regional and corporate  levels, while taking advantage of economies of scale and the cost benefits of ICT  governance. The Service will also support the expansion of a global sourcing  approach for ICT, including enterprise applications, migration to cloud computing  and further development of enterprise-wide ICT contracts that will leverage the  buying power of the entire Secretariat. Corporate services will include key  consultancies and training and implementing partners that are used for a wide array  of clients in the Secretariat, both at Headquarters and in the field. They also include  specialized, high-value services such as banking, outside legal counsel and insurance  services. Real estate, engineering and construction form another key area with  meaningful opportunities for rationalization and savings. The Service will provide  services with a global perspective in strategic capital review projects and related  infrastructure and facilities management in support of field missions and the other  Secretariat entities.   219. The Service will coordinate acquisition activities closely with the Logistics  Division, the Office of Information and Communications Technology and other  clients and stakeholders in the Secretariat for the relevant categories.        Uniformed Capabilities Support Division    220. Over 90,000 military and police personnel are currently deployed to United  Nations peace operations. Multiple organizational units across the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support, the Department of  Management and, in the case of special political missions, the Department of Political  Affairs, are currently involved in the end-to-end force-generation process. The current  arrangements make it difficult to obtain a holistic view of the support requirements  of and reimbursement to individual contingents and units, and the need to cross  organizational boundaries creates process delays that impede service delivery. It is  therefore proposed that all of the related functions currently residing in the  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  52/246    Memorandum of Understanding and Claims Management Section and the  Reimbursement Policy and Liaison Section of the Field Budget and Finance Division,  the Contingent-Owned Equipment Unit in the Logistics Support Division and the  Financial Information Operations Service in the Office of Programme Planning,  Budget and Accounts be consolidated into a single Uniformed Capabilities Support  Division.   221. The Division will serve as the single point of entry within the Secretariat for  support and reimbursement issues related to military and police contingents, for both  Member States and counterparts within the Secretariat, including the proposed  Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace  Operations. The consolidation of these functions will address the current  fragmentation in the support aspects of the end-to-end force-generation process and  will allow the Department to better serve the needs of other stakeholders, more  effectively analyse different sources of data to identify and address areas of concern  and more efficiently manage verification and reimbursement. It will also allow for  closer coordination with other units within the Office of Supply Chain Management  that provide support to troop- and police-contributing countries, such as the  Movement Control Section.        Memorandum of Understanding and Reimbursement Policy Section    222. The Memorandum of Understanding and Reimbursement Policy Section will be  responsible for policies and procedures related to the reimbursement to troop- and  police-contributing countries and the verification and control of contingent-owned  equipment, for support to the triennial meetings of the Working Group on Contingent- Owned Equipment and updating the Manual on Policies and Procedures Concerning  the Reimbursement and Control of Contingent-Owned Equipment (see A/72/288) and  for undertaking the quadrennial survey of personnel costs established by the General  Assembly in its resolution 67/261. The Section will also lead the negotiations with  troop- and police-contributing countries in preparing memorandums of understanding  to support the deployment of formed military and police units. It will serve as the  primary focal point for communications between permanent missions of troop- and  police-contributing countries and the Secretariat on questions related to  reimbursement and the memorandums of understanding and subsequent amendments,  where applicable.   223. The establishment of this Section will capitalize on the benefits already evident  from the restructuring of the Memorandum of Understanding and Claims  Management Section and the establishment of the Reimbursement Policy and Liaison  Section approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 69/308. The restructuring  has already allowed the Secretariat to more effectively respond to queries from  Member States regarding reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment and  formed military and police units, to support the work of the Working Group on  Contingent-Owned Equipment and to reduce the number of unsigned memorandums  of understanding, from 64 of 368 in 2015 to 35 of 271 in 2018.        Reimbursement Claims Management and Performance Section    224. The Reimbursement Claims Management and Performance Section will be  responsible for the calculation, analysis and processing of reimbursement to troop-  and police-contributing countries for contingent personnel, major equipment and self- sustainment, as well as death and disability compensation for uniformed personnel. It  will also calculate the wet lease, dry lease and maintenance rates applicable for each  formed unit in accordance with the decisions of the General Assembly and prepare  estimates for the costs associated with reimbursement to troop- and police- contributing countries for inclusion in budget proposals.     A/72/492/Add.2    53/246  18-04386    225. The new Section will also take responsibility for the verification framework for  field missions, ensuring that appropriate processes and robust controls are in place to  measure deployed and serviceable equipment capabilities in field missions. A greater  emphasis on performance information and analysis will also ensure that gaps in  operational performance can be identified and that reimbursement is appropriately  aligned with performance.   226. It is proposed that the Section be established through the consolidation of the  claims-processing and data analysis functions of the Memorandum of Understanding  and Claims Management Section, the Contingent-Owned Equipment Unit and the  Financial Information Operations Service. The consolidation will facilitate the  holistic analysis of reimbursement-related issues and more efficient processing of  claims.        D. Division for Special Activities      227. The Division for Special Activities will oversee a range of specialized and cross- cutting operational capacities. A key element of its responsibilities will be the exercise  of authority on behalf of clients that lack the capacity to do so accountably, including  the offices of special advisers and envoys at Headquarters or in the field, start-up  missions or those whose authorities have been withdrawn. The specific requirements  for different clients will be met through dedicated staffing resources or, particularly  for start-up and surge requirements, through the formation of temporary teams with  subject matter experts drawn from the Office of Support Operations, the Office of  Supply Chain Management and the Office of Information and Communications  Technology. The Division will also include the Operational Planning Service to help  identify and plan for emerging support requirements, the Support Partnerships Service  to coordinate support provided by the Department to non-Secretariat entities and an  operational training and knowledge management capacity.  228. In addition, six support officers that will support, as required, the integrated  operational teams in the regional structure of the peace and security architecture will  report administratively to the Office of the Director in a manner similar to the current  administrative arrangement for the support officers of the Department of Field  Support embedded in the integrated operational teams of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations.        Resource Planning and Analysis Section    229. The Resource Planning and Analysis Section will take an integrated approach  in working with counterparts across the Department of Operational Support to ensure  that efforts to support client groups across the Secretariat are in line with  organizational priorities and other objectives related to value for money and resource  stewardship. With a focus on data-driven analysis, the Section will work with  counterparts in examining major resourcing drivers and practices within the  responsibilities of the Department of Operational Support to ensure cost-effective  operational support solutions.   230. The placement of the Section within the Division for Special Activities will  enable it to contribute to major operational support efforts and projects across the  Department of Operational Support. The Section will integrate and harmonize  performance and cost analysis across the various pillars of the Department and  measure the impact of the Department's major resource efficiency efforts. It will  provide support and input on best practices and practical, operational solutions to the  various entities within the Department of Operational Support to assist them in the  delivery of support to clients throughout the Secretariat. The Section will also develop  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  54/246    operational resourcing standards to guide the work of the Department of Operational  Support and its client entities and coordinate the input of the Department into strategic  mission reviews and civilian staffing reviews.        Operational Planning Service    231. Planning activities are currently conducted at all levels across the Secretariat in  a non-integrated manner, with fragmented accountability and responsibility for the  disparate planning functions. Furthermore, performance management on planning  functions has been lacking; consequently, its alignment with the strategic goals of the  Organization and compliance with the established planning policies and guidelines  have not been consistent. A dedicated and integrated planning capacity is required to  translate the needs of clients across the Secretariat into effective and efficient support  solutions.   232. Establishment of a new operational planning capacity is proposed to support  client requirements, particularly in the case of new or changing mandates; to provide  technical assistance and advice regarding support-related planning to clients; and to  maintain planning guidelines and standard operating procedures. This capacity will  build on the existing Operational Support Team in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary-General for Field Support, which currently coordinates planning for and  operational support to peace operation start-ups and transitions. It will also  incorporate human resources planning expertise currently resident within the Field  Personnel Division, which will provide support to entities on integrated human  resources planning processes in the context of the establishment of new entities and  the expansion and/or downsizing of existing entities. It will also leverage the  capacities of the Resource Planning and Analysis Section, which will be located in  the same Division, for support on financial planning in such situations. The  integration of these related functions will allow for a more holistic approach to  operational support planning by the Department of Operational Support. To address  planning requirements in peace operations contexts, this capacity would complement  and work closely with the planning capacity within the proposed Office of the Under- Secretary-General of Peace Operations.   233. The Service will work very closely with the Client Support and Special  Situations Section during periods of major activity, such as mission start-up,  transition and liquidation.        Client Support and Special Situations Section    234. The Client Support and Special Situations Section will provide advisory and  support services to entities during start-up, transition, downsizing and liquidation and  assist with overall planning and implementation. It will backstop personnel in affected  entities and provide career support through guidance to managers and staff and  assistance with the placement of downsized staff across the Secretariat. The Section  will review whether existing regulations, rules and policies are fit for purpose in  special situations and liaise with the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance to address challenges and gaps identified. The Section will establish and  maintain dedicated surge capacity support through established standby arrangements  and rosters to facilitate rapid and timely deployment and serve as a focal point for  support to entities in emergency situations and the development of action plans and  after-action reviews, thus increasing emergency preparedness across the Secretariat  and ensuring consistency in operational support in crisis management.  235. During start-up, surge and crisis situations, the Client Support and Special  Situations Section will be augmented temporarily by staff drawn from the Office of  Support Operations, the Office of Supply Chain Management and the Office of    A/72/492/Add.2    55/246  18-04386    Information and Communications Technology, as required, to meet immediate  support requirements until the crisis has ended or resources have been identified or  approved to meet the requirements on an ongoing basis.         Support Partnerships Service     236. In the past decade, the United Nations has increasingly been asked to provide  support to non-United Nations peace operations, including operations mandated or  authorized by the African Union. Currently, the United Nations supports two such  operations -- the African Union Mission in Somalia and the Group of Five for the  Sahel joint force -- in addition to its joint deployment of the African Union-United  Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. In recent years, it also supported the African-led  International Support Mission in Mali and the African-led International Support  Mission in the Central African Republic prior to their transition to United Nations  peacekeeping missions. It is also working to strengthen cooperation with regional  organizations such as the European Union and the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe. Such partnerships are expected to become increasingly  important in addressing challenges to international peace and security, as United  Nations peace operations may not always be the most appropriate or effective  response to particular situations.  237. Support relationships, however, are not a one-way street; there are situations in  which the United Nations will require assistance from regional organizations or  bilateral providers in order to deliver on mandates. These can be standing  arrangements, such as the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement with the United  States of America, or situation-specific agreements, such as the specialist support for  weapons decommissioning for the United Nations Mission in Colombia provided by  the Government of Germany and support provided by the Government of France to  the missions in Mali and the Central African Republic.  238. It is proposed that the remit of the current Headquarters Support Team for the  United Nations Support Office in Somalia, which is currently responsible for  managing the mission support partnership with the African Union, be expanded to  cover all support partnerships in a new Support Partnerships Service. While the  Controller will continue to lead and be the focal point for financial aspects of all  agreements with regional organizations, the Service will be responsible for  maintaining relationships with regional organizations and bilateral support providers,  for negotiating agreements and memorandums of understanding, in consultation with  the Office of Finance and Budget, for monitoring the support provided to or received  from non-Secretariat entities and for coordinating with relevant counterparts within  the Secretariat to address support issues. In order to cover the full range of activities  that will be performed by the new Service, it is proposed that the capacities from the  current Headquarters Support Team be augmented by redeploying two additional P-5  posts to the Service: one post of Senior Support Officer from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support and one post of Senior Finance Officer  from the Field Budget and Finance Division, given the financial dimensions of many  support agreements.         Integrated operational teams    239. Support officers from the Department of Field Support are currently embedded  in the integrated operational teams in the Office of Operations in the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations to provide expertise on issues pertaining to mission support.  It is proposed that six Support Officers from the Department of Operational Support  be made available to the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations to provide  the necessary support to the integrated operational teams for peacekeeping operations  in the regional structure of the peace and security architecture, in a flexible manner.   A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  56/246      E.  Division of Administration, New York      240. Administrative services for offices and departments at Headquarters are  currently performed by the Department of Management. It is proposed that, in the  future, location-specific services be delivered by a Division of Administration in New  York in the manner of the divisions of administration at the offices away from  Headquarters. The Division will consist of the Headquarters Client Support Section,  the Headquarters Information and Communications Technology Support Section and  the Facilities and Commercial Activities Service. It will provide building  management and engineering services and information and communications  technology services for all offices and departments at Headquarters. It will also  provide financial and budgetary services and support the management of the human  resources requirements of the Department of Operational Support, the Office of  Information and Communications Technology and the offices in New York that do not  have their own executive offices or administrative units.   241. As the majority of the posts in the Division of Administration will come from  the existing Facilities and Commercial Services Division of the Office of Central  Support Services, it is proposed that the Office of the Director for Facilities and  Commercial Services be reprofiled as the new Office of the Director of  Administration.         Headquarters Client Support Section    242. Executive offices and administrative units support heads of entities and  programme managers in carrying out their financial, personnel and general  administrative responsibilities. Under the new management paradigm, and with the  transfer of transactional functions to shared service centres under the global service  delivery model, executive officers and chiefs of administration across the Secretariat  will have a more strategic business partner role in assisting heads of entities in their  exercise of delegated authorities. At Headquarters, however, many offices are too  small to have their own executive offices and are therefore supported by the executive  offices of other departments.   243. The Headquarters Client Support Section will, in the future, serve as a business  partner for not only the units of the Department of Operational Support located at  Headquarters and the Office of Information and Communications Technology, but  also 13 offices currently supported by the Executive Office of the Secretary-General,  the Executive Office of the Department of Management and the joint Executive Office  of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.  Altogether, the Section will serve approximately 1,300 posts at Headquarters.         Headquarters Information and Communications Technology Support Section    244. New York Headquarters campus ICT operations will be transferred from the  Office of Information and Communications Technology to the Division of  Administration, as the functions of the latter are limited to the provision of support to  clients in New York. The Section will consist of a Broadcasting and Conference  Support Unit, a Headquarters Service Desk, a Headquarters Local Area Network  Operations Unit, a Headquarters Data Centre Management Unit and a Headquarters  Physical Security Support Unit. These units will directly manage and support the day- to-day ICT operations in New York, including ICT and conference support provided  to Member States, conference webcasting, public wireless networks, the operations  of electronic security systems, turnstiles, access control and surveillance systems. The  Section will also be responsible for disaster recovery and business continuity for ICT  systems at Headquarters.     A/72/492/Add.2    57/246  18-04386    245. The Section will deliver its services in line with the policies and standards set  by the Office of Information and Communications Technology and the overall  operational ICT landscape of the Secretariat.         Facilities and Commercial Activities Service    246. The proposed organizational structure of the Department incorporates all of the  local Headquarters services currently in the Facilities Management Service, with the  exception of the Global Property Management Service. It also incorporates the  components within the Commercial Activities Service, including the Travel and  Transportation Section and the Archives and Records Management Section, with the  exception of the policy capacity in both Sections, as well as the United Nations Postal  Administration.   247. As part of its responsibilities for managing local operations at Headquarters, the  Service will be responsible for the development and maintenance of the  environmental management system for New York and for the reduction of the  environmental impact of Secretariat activities in New York.        VIII. Office of Information and Communications Technology       248. The core goals of the information and communications technology strategy are  to better leverage information and communications technology as a critical enabler,  increase harmonization, and protect the Organization against the increasing risk of  cybersecurity threats. In view of its central role, the Secretary-General proposes to  establish ICT as a unified pillar led by the Assistant Secretary-General, Chief  Information Technology Officer, reporting to the Under-Secretaries-General of both  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department  of Operational Support. That structure and placement will allow the Organization to  rapidly build upon and leverage gains already made through the implementation of  the ICT strategy and accelerate the implementation of its remaining phases and  elements, especially in ongoing harmonization efforts. The proposed unified structure  will also establish an empowered and agile organization that is ready to leverage  technological innovation, optimize resources and address significant and ever- growing cybersecurity threats.  249. A unified approach will ensure the successful implementation of the global ICT  strategy. The proposed unified ICT pillar will ensure that technology enables the core  work of the United Nations in the areas of peace and security, human rights,  international  law  and  development,  humanitarian  affairs  and  sustainable  development. It will provide expeditious services to all Secretariat clients, in  particular the field operations, through the review and implementation of updates,  policies, standards, governance and tools. This will give all entities access to uniform  delivery of ICT solutions and services as well as improved service delivery through  global, regional and local collaboration.  250. Those structural changes will facilitate nimble ICT operations that are relevant  and positioned for the rapid delivery of solutions. Advances in technology will allow  the Office to fully leverage cloud technologies and deliver under increasing financial  and time constraints. It is also proposed that cybersecurity be linked closely to  operations to ensure that the Organization will be able to respond quickly to current  and future cyberthreats.   251. Meeting cross-functional requirements of the entire Organization and Member  States is a critical requirement and a mainstay of the Secretary-General's reform  efforts. A unified ICT pillar that combines strategic and operational functions will  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  58/246    better serve those critical needs. The Organization's ability to meet all of the  requirements is enhanced when the strategic, policy and compliance functions are  placed closer to the clients and end users, which also strengthens its ability to bring  decision-making closer to the clients, a core objective of the current management  reform proposals.  252. The ultimate objective of the ICT function is to provide improved, more agile  services that address Organizational requirements at the local, regional and corporate  levels, while managing risks and ensuring user satisfaction. Client engagement at all  levels will ensure that ICT services and solutions enable the United Nations to more  effectively and accountably deliver its programmes and mandates. The driving  principle is to focus on client services and innovation for the entire Secretariat. Client  services will be coordinated from the bottom up and from the top down so that there  is local autonomy supported by a governance framework, policies and standards that  work for all.   253. A coherent service delivery model is proposed for the single ICT pillar,  leveraging existing resources and mechanisms and bringing together the various  organizational components in order to concentrate all efforts on effective delivery to  support the Organization in carrying out its substantive and operational work locally  at diverse locations around the world. The model comprises three interlinked but  distinct layers, each with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as set out below.   254. The first layer encompasses the strategy, direction and global implementation  of activities managed at United Nations Headquarters. The second layer is focused on  supporting local operations through the implementation of globalized technology  solutions supported through the Global Service Centre at Brindisi, Italy, and Valencia,  Spain. The regional ICT framework and the regional technology centres represent and  serve the interests and needs of local offices and field operations by geographical  location. They are responsible to regional client boards, with additional reporting  lines to Headquarters. The regional entities ensure that ICT is close to its clients and  responsive to their needs, while at the same time local offices benefit from  coordinated direction from Headquarters and the leveraging of regional initiatives.  Those two layers exist solely in support of layer three, the tactical layer, comprising  the ICT teams within the local structures, which is focused on the effective delivery  of technology solutions and the provision of support to the local community of end  users.  255. While the three layers act as one technology service delivery mechanism, each  one has direct responsibilities towards each particular entity, its leadership and its  mandate. The structures, mechanisms and governance that dictate the model's internal  and external relationships are critical to its overall effectiveness. They will be aligned  with the proposed Management Client Board for the two new departments and will  be supplemented by regional client boards, service-level agreements with clear key  performance indicators, and additional reporting lines, where relevant. The single ICT  delivery model will lead to standardized delivery of services across diverse entities.  The model is designed for the clear assignment of roles and responsibilities and the  creation of linkages and mechanisms to ensure that services are delivered effectively  across a complex global span of delivery and control.  256. Limitations associated with the organizational and budgetary partition between  peacekeeping and non-peacekeeping activities have been overcome for some ICT  services through the combination of various funding mechanisms, including the  service delivery model, which encompasses directly budgeted services and services  provided to other entities, funded through cost recovery and governed by a mature  and robust service-level management framework. For example, such services as data  centre hosting and storage, connectivity, ICT security and event monitoring are    A/72/492/Add.2    59/246  18-04386    provided to peacekeeping missions as well as to 14 non-peacekeeping entities by the  Global Service Centre at Brindisi and Valencia. Similarly, geospatial information  systems services are provided both to peacekeeping operations and to bodies such as  the Security Council, including its panels of experts, the Executive Office of the  Secretary-General, the United Nations Operations and Crisis Centre and all offices  and departments of the Secretariat. Another example is the global provision of email  and collaboration tools, which are also funded through cost-recovery mechanisms. It  will therefore be necessary to expand on this integrated budgetary funding model  when the unified ICT entity assumes responsibility for the provision of technological  support and services to the entire Secretariat.  257. An important element of the single pillar model is the introduction of  normalized key performance indicators and standardized measures of achievement  that focus on the delivery of ICT support to all entities and respond to client demands.  Services provided through service-level agreements will foster enhanced  comparability, consistency and clarity concerning the performance of ICT operational  services. The indicators can be an efficient tool for measuring the effectiveness of  ICT services. They are also paramount for continuous service improvement, as they  facilitate the identification of areas that require attention or where indicators can be  refined to meet critical targets.  258. Local ICT teams will be empowered and will perform functions in compliance  with policies; governance is intended to further streamline processes using a client- based approach to foster agility. Local operations will include user support,  cybersecurity and risk management, support for local networks and ICT  infrastructure, and the use of innovative technology and the development of solutions  that address local programmatic needs.  259. The Secretariat's future systems will be secure, cost effective, standardized and  supported by interoperable platforms, in compliance with centralized ICT architecture  policies and governance. The Organization will use innovative technology to  accelerate the delivery of solutions, including frontier technologies such as artificial  intelligence and machine learning, to keep pace with rapid technological advances,  together with the evolving needs of the Organization.   260. The unified ICT pillar will provide expeditious services, support and solutions  to all Secretariat clients, in particular the field operations, through the review and  implementation of updates, policies, standards, governance and tools. This will give  all entities access to uniform delivery of ICT solutions as well as improved service  delivery through global, regional and local collaboration. The unified ICT  organization will be responsible for ensuring effective, efficient, coherent and  accountable ICT programmes and services, resource management and compliance  with ICT policies and standards.         Office of the Assistant-Secretary-General, Chief Information  Technology Officer      261. The Assistant Secretary-General, Chief Information Technology Officer, will be  accountable jointly to the Under-Secretary-General for Management, Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. The  Office of the Assistant Secretary-General will continue to provide strategic direction  and leadership for the implementation of Organization-wide ICT and for planning and  coordinating ICT activities Secretariat-wide, ensuring the effective and efficient  utilization of resources in the modernization of information systems and the  improvement of the Secretariat-wide information and communications services  worldwide to a consistent standard of functionality, quality and reliability. The Office  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  60/246    will set the overall strategic direction and provide enterprise solutions and  infrastructure with a view to achieving coherence and coordination and will support  the reform agenda, which is aimed at strengthening accountability by embedding  accountability mechanisms into enterprise systems. The Office will include  cybersecurity and enterprise programme management teams to strengthen  information security throughout the Secretariat as well as to provide a standardized  approach to the oversight of ICT programmes.  262. Any given ICT solution requires an integrated set of services. For example,  email requires infrastructure, mobile technology, application services and service  desk and cybersecurity support. It is therefore proposed that the ICT units of the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support be transformed into  three tightly integrated areas: operations support; policy, strategy and governance;  and enterprise solutions, as described below. Those areas will report to the Assistant  Secretary-General, Chief Information Technology Officer. ICT-related activities will  be implemented within a common normative framework, with strong, agile  governance and in accordance with the ICT strategy.        Operations Support Division    263. The Operations Support Division will comprise the Office of the Director, the  Service Operations Service, the Technology Operations Service, the Regional Service  Management Service and the Technology Solutions Section.   264. The Division will be responsible for all ICT operations across the Secretariat,  including field operations. It will develop, manage, monitor and optimize the  infrastructure on which the Organization's global technology solutions, systems and  applications are delivered. This includes the United Nations data centre and the ""one  United Nations"" network. It will manage the platforms on which applications are  developed in a governed, structured and secure manner. It will configure and deliver  in a secure and intuitive manner, products and tools to enable client mobility and  flexibility and to optimize the client's digital experience.   265. By utilizing the regional frameworks, the Division will manage the delivery of  uniform client services across the Secretariat; provide leadership and engagement and  coordinate operations across a diverse Secretariat landscape; support offices and field  missions by simplifying and prioritizing operational compliance and standardization  activities; provide the regional mechanisms for managers and clients to develop and  communicate ICT requirements and formulate and track the implementation of  technologies in support of local goals and objectives; field-test proofs of concept and  pilot initiatives and promote the harmonization and optimization of core activities.   266. The Division will oversee and direct operations at the Global Service Centre  operational hubs at Brindisi and Valencia, provide round-the-clock monitoring of  operations across the Secretariat's ICT landscape from the Network Control Centre  and escalate incidents to appropriate support teams. It will ensure that economies of  scale are leveraged by providing ICT services to other offices on a cost-recovery  basis. The Division will also broker and manage cloud services and activities and  manage operational information security activities. In support of mission/office start- up and expansion, the Division will develop and implement rapidly deployable and  modularized solutions and manage and catalogue ICT services and oversee the  transition of new operational activities into production.  267. As part of the ICT service delivery framework, the Division will manage Unite  service desks and put in place mechanisms and procedures to optimize client  satisfaction, providing a virtual point of entry for clients, and to standardize the  approach to managing incidents and requests for service across entities. The Division  will also ensure visibility of the technology landscape to allow for informed and    A/72/492/Add.2    61/246  18-04386    effective decision-making, ensure that all operational activities are aligned with  enterprise architecture, integrate cross-cutting activities with operations where end- to-end solutions are required and provide non-enterprise field-specific technology  solutions, manage field-specific signals training and staff development programmes,  where applicable, facilitate the preparation and migration of current solutions to cloud  hosting, optimize the impact of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products and  develop and support the implementation of business intelligence strategies to  facilitate self-service analytics at the local level.         Policy, Strategy and Governance Division    268. The Policy, Strategy and Governance Division will comprise the Director's  office, the Policy and Compliance Service, the Records Management Unit and the  Data Management and Privacy Unit.  269. The Division, in consultation with entities across the Secretariat as well as other  United Nations system organizations, will define, update and provide oversight for  the timely implementation of the ICT strategy, ensuring that ICT initiatives and  services are aligned with the core work of the Organization and that they provide agile  responses to organizational requirements. Innovative technology would be used to  bring about modernization and transformation across all areas and entities.  270. Policies and standards will be established covering infrastructure, hardware,  software and methodologies that will ensure that ICT work is performed in a  consistent manner across the Organization. A normative framework will be  established to facilitate agile and rapid operations within a predefined and  collaboratively agreed framework. This policy framework will minimize the risk of  duplication, achieve economies of scale to contain cost, be conducive to the sharing  of information and solutions and ensure optimal operational support. The  establishment of policies and standards will be done in coordination with entities  across the Secretariat, taking into consideration the rest of the United Nations system,  so as to achieve interconnectivity and promote collaboration.  271. The Records Management Unit will be responsible for establishing policy and  setting standards for the management of the records and archives of the United  Nations, including their use, storage and disposition, as well as public access to them,  will support Secretariat-wide efforts to strengthen and ensure compliance with digital  and physical records management policies and will provide expert advice on digital  record-keeping. The team will also facilitate the integration of records management  into the accountability framework.  272. Data management and privacy are central to ensuring that the information flow  supports operational effectiveness while ensuring privacy and the integrity of  information. As the use of integrated enterprise systems increases, the potential for  information privacy issues to have a negative impact on operations increases as well.  The Data Management and Privacy Unit will establish policies for the management  and handling of data and will monitor compliance to ensure that privacy imperatives  are integrated into technology and data solutions.  273. Governance refers to the design, implementation and continuous adjustment of  mechanisms to ensure that ICT solutions are aligned with the needs, priorities and  standards of the Organization in order to efficiently support the United Nations  programmes of work. This objective is achieved through processes that ensure that  ICT resources are used responsibly, that investments in technology are transparent  and prioritized in alignment with organizational objectives and that the requirements  are addressed in an agile and timely manner. Such processes protect the Organization  from reputational and operational risks by ensuring that the ICT infrastructure,  applications and services are designed, built, maintained and operated in compliance  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  62/246    with United Nations policies and standards. Governance will include such cross- departmental and cross-entity mechanisms as the ICT Executive Committee, the ICT  Board, the Enterprise Project Management Office and the Architecture Review Board,  among others. The representative and adequate participation of clients will be ensured  in the composition of those bodies.        Enterprise Solutions Service    274. The Enterprise Solutions Service will comprise the Office of the Chief, the  enterprise applications centres for the Americas and for Asia and the data modelling  and management team. The Service will carry out the following three main functions:    * Coordinate the governance of overarching ICT systems and solutions to ensure  that the necessary elements, such as an ""app store"", are in place to ensure the  agile development of applications at the appropriate level. The aim is to address  client requirements (at, e.g., the local, regional, departmental or enterprise  level), taking into account the needs and priorities of the Organization and  unique local requirements and to ensure that investments in solutions are  transparent and prioritized accordingly. This will be done together with local  and regional ICT and business teams, which will play a key role in systems  governance.    * Work in close collaboration with clients to design, develop and support  enterprise solutions, which are, by definition, large scale, complex, scalable,  distributed, component based and mission critical in nature. They are designed  to integrate core systems and processes across all areas of the Organization,  bridging silos to facilitate the coordination of work and the delivery of services,  reducing the duplication of effort and information. The functions will include  analysis of client requirements, architecture, design and the development of  standardized solutions that respond to the accelerated pace and dynamic  demands placed on the Organization. It will leverage cutting-edge technologies  and services, such as cloud-based software. By working with regional and local  ICT teams, the Enterprise Solutions Service will take a flexible and agile  approach to the delivery of solutions that comply with policies, standards,  architecture and information security requirements.     * Together with regional and local ICT teams and following business and ICT  governance and policies and standards, the Service will continue to enhance the  quality and availability of data, strengthening and expanding data structures and  data dictionaries and assisting clients with the documentation necessary to  empower them to use a self-service approach to producing and sharing  information.        IX. Global Shared Service Centres      275. Global shared services will be delivered under the overall purview of the Under- Secretary-General for Operational Support and led by the Director, Global Shared  Services, who will oversee the chiefs of the individual shared service centres. The  Director, supported by a team, will ensure quality, build standardization and optimize  resources and costs across global shared services. The Office of the Director will be  responsible for operational monitoring, the optimization of processes performed in  service centres and staff and client training and will include client engagement units,  which will be co-located within one of the shared service centres.  276. The Operational Monitoring Unit will monitor and report on service centre and  staff performance and provide global reporting in line with the performance    A/72/492/Add.2    63/246  18-04386    framework mechanisms, including service-level agreements and key performance  indicators. The Process Optimization Unit will support the continual improvement of  the performance of shared service centres by identifying and managing service  improvement projects and driving process re-engineering and changes, as needed. The  Staff and Client Training Unit will provide consistent training and capacity  development for shared service centre staff and will develop and deliver training for  clients of the shared service centres, particularly during transition periods. The Client  Engagement Unit will deliver clear, timely and relevant communications to  stakeholders through multiple communication channels, including online and print  media and in-person visits. The head of the Unit will be responsible for client  engagement and support across all service centres. The team will work in close  collaboration with the individual shared service centres and with Headquarters to  facilitate effective and efficient shared service operations.  277. More information regarding the Office of the Director and the service centres is  provided in the report of the Secretary-General on the global service delivery model  for the United Nations Secretariat (A/72/801).        X. Revised estimates       278. The present section contains an outline of the programmatic and financial  consequences with respect to the biennial programme plan and priorities for the  period 2018-2019 and the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019 arising  from the reorganization of the Department of Management and the Department of  Field Support as the new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and Department of Operational Support. In particular, the changes  affecting programme 4, Peacekeeping operations, and programme 25, Management  and support services, of the biennial programme plan and priorities for 2018-2019  and the related sections of the budget, namely, section 5, Peacekeeping operations,  section 29, Management and support services, and subsections 29A to 29E, are  presented. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the resource implications  of the reorganization of the two departments, details of the post and financial  resources proposed to be funded under the support account for peacekeeping  operations, as well as the estimated resources from voluntary contributions, are  included in the tables in the present report. With respect to resources to be funded  under the support account, annex III below provides information on the impact of the  reorganization on post resources, including redeployments, reassignments and  reclassifications, and the associated financial resource requirements for the period  from 1 January to 30 June 2019. Detailed explanations on post and non-post  requirements for the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 are presented in the  report of the Secretary-General on the budget for the support account (A/72/790).   279. The changes required in the 2018-2019 biennial programme plan and priorities  and programme budget are set out in table 1.

Programme  4,  Peacekeeping  operations,  will  no  longer  include  subprogramme 5, Field administrative support, or subprogramme 6, Integrated  support services, as the activities of those subprogrammes will be subsumed under  programme 25, Management and support services.  281. The new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will be  responsible for the enterprise resource planning project, the secretariat of the Fifth  Committee and the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Management  Evaluation Unit, and the finance and budget, human resources, and business  transformation and accountability functions.  282. In addition, under programme 25, the Department will be responsible for  support operations, supply chain management, special activities, administration, New  York, and the Global Shared Service Centres.   283. In order to better present a holistic view of the resources of each department, it  is proposed that the budget fascicles for 2020 and onward for sections 29A to 29G be  prepared at the subsection level. The subsection 29A budget fascicle will include  components 1-4, and the subsection 29B fascicle will include components 1-5.  284. The posts approved for the current Department of Management and Department  of Field Support are proposed to be redistributed, for 2019, to the new Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational  Support. The resulting impacts on the resources for the biennium 2018-2019 of the  current Department of Field Support, under section 5, Peacekeeping operations, and  the Department of Management, under section 29, Management and support services,  are presented in table 2.

A/72/492/Add.2    67/246  18-04386    285. The proposed financial and staffing resources for the new Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational  Support are set out in table 3. The resources presented in tables 2 and 3, as well as in  the rest of the report, exclude 40 posts proposed to be abolished as a result of the  transfer of functions to the Global Shared Service Centres. The total resources  proposed for the centres are presented in the report of the Secretary-General on the  global service delivery model (A/72/801).   286. The reorganization of the Department of Management and Department of Field  Support as the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and  Department of Operational Support will result in the redeployment of 733 posts  funded from the programme budget whose functions will remain unchanged. In  addition, 31 posts funded from the programme budget have been identified whose  functions would change in the new departments and are proposed to be reassigned  accordingly. The details of those posts are presented under each office in the sections  that follow. A vacancy rate of 50 per cent for posts in the Professional and higher  categories and 35 per cent for posts in the General Service and related categories have  been applied to the costing of the 31 posts. In addition, one post (Trades and Crafts)  is proposed to be abolished.   287. As indicated in paragraph 8 above, the Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support will be constituted  from the posts approved for 2019 for the current Department of Management and  Department of Field Support. To facilitate the hiring by programme managers of the  staff required to deliver the benefits of the reorganization, it is proposed that the 5 per  cent reduction in post resources approved by the General Assembly in its resolution  72/261 under sections 29C, 29D and 29E not be applied for the year 2019 to the two  new departments. This proposal is reflected in the cost estimates set out below.  Overall, the reform will entail a reduction in post resources in the amount of  $510,100, which will be reflected in the first performance report for the biennium.

On this basis, the General Assembly is requested to take the following  actions, to take effect on 1 January 2019:    A/72/492/Add.2    191/246  18-04386      (a)  Approve the proposed reorganization of the current Department of  Management and Department of Field Support into the proposed new  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department  of Operational Support, as detailed in the present report;    (b)  Approve the proposed new subsections 29A to 29D of section 29,  Management and support services, of the programme budget for the biennium  2018-2019, as presented in table 1 of the present report;    (c)  Approve the related redistribution of posts and non-post resources,  including the redeployments and reassignments of posts, from the current  Department of Management and Department of Field Support into the new  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department  of Operational Support, as well as the abolishment of one post (Trades and  Crafts);    (d)  Take note of the reduced requirements under post resources for the  biennium 2018-2019, in the estimated amount of $510,100, which will be  reported in the context of the first performance report for the biennium;    (e)  Approve, in the context of the proposed budget for the support  account for peacekeeping operations for the 2018/19 period, the related  redistribution of post and non-post resources, including the redeployments and  reassignments of posts, from the current Department of Management and  Department of Field Support into the new Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational Support.

Inventory of strategic, policymaking, compliance, operational and  support activities      1.  The inventory of activities currently performed by the Department of Field  Support and the Department of Management will be provided separately to the  General Assembly on account of its length and format.         B. Analysis of scalability of the proposed Department of  Operational Support      2.  The concept of scalability applies to all activities in the Secretariat to some  degree. The resource requirements of the departments will change on the basis of the  amount of support delivered to clients across the Secretariat, but the relationship  between staffing and support requirements is not linear. Requirements in some  functions, such as those responsible for executive direction, performance  management and analytics, are largely static. For functions that are scalable, resource  requirements often depend on several factors.  3.  For the Department of Operational Support, the staffing of many functions,  particularly those related to service delivery and capacity development, depends on  the number of staff served. Certain functions, such as movement control and  reimbursement claims processing, depend on the number of military contingents and  formed police units deployed. Others, such as examinations and roster management,  depend on a variety of factors such as the number of rosters to update and the number  of applicants for generic job openings. Moreover, the level of support required by all  types of entities is not consistent across the Secretariat; for example, field missions,  because of their decentralized geographical distribution, sometimes in remote  inaccessible areas and often under dangerous and volatile conditions, require  dedicated central backstopping requirements for operational aspects that are not  evidenced in the non-field environment geographical locations. Although scalability  in these functions applies to all organizational units, the fact that volatility in the  number of staff or client entities exists primarily in field operations means that  changes in the level of staffing requirements for these functions will occur primarily  as a result of changes in the number and size of field missions.   4.  It must be noted, however, that the initial level of staffing proposed for the  Department of Operational Support is based primarily on the number of posts  available as a result of the post-neutral exercise of allocating existing resources from  the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management. Whether this  will continue to represent the staffing baseline for the delivery of services to entities  across the Secretariat under a new decentralized paradigm will become clear only  after the new structures have been in place for some time. At the same time, the level  of staffing required in clients will also need to be adjusted not only to ensure that they  have the level of resources required to discharge their responsibilities under the new  paradigm, but also to reflect a consistent approach as to how support functions are  staffed across the Secretariat.         A/72/492/Add.2    203/246  18-04386      C. Mapping of the current and envisaged delegation of authority      5.  The detailed mapping of the current and envisaged delegation of authority will  be provided separately to the General Assembly on account of its length and format.         D. Effect of the establishment of the two departments on the internal  control regime and on the roles of the Assistant Secretary-General/  Controller, the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support  Services and the Assistant Secretary-General/Chief Information  Technology Officer          Assistant Secretary-General/Controller    6.  The internal control system currently in place in the Office of Programme  Planning, Budget and Accounts that governs the transactions that have a financial  impact will evolve to recognize the new segregation of duties between the Department  of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational  Support and the new structure of delegation of authority that will flow from the  Secretary-General to the heads of offices. The implementation of the statement of  internal control will be a self-attestation tool to monitor the effectiveness of the  internal control system that exists to produce the institutional financial reports.        Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services    7.  The post of Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services will no  longer exist, but there will be additional roles created in the new Department of  Operational Support which, if staffed properly, will strengthen the internal control  regime.        Assistant Secretary-General/Chief Information Technology Officer    8.  Based on the recommendations of the Board of Auditors (see A/67/651) and on  the information and communications technology (ICT) strategy (A/69/517), efforts  have been under way to ensure an appropriate balance of operational freedom and  central control. Management reform proposes that the ICT organizations of the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support be combined to  create a unified and coherent approach to ICT, which is in line with the decisions of  the General Assembly and the imperative to harmonize ICT while supporting  operational agility. The consolidation of ICT will strengthen control by ensuring that  the control regime supports operations and that, concomitantly, operational needs on  the ground inform the control regime. Through this approach, an optimal balance of  control and coherence with operations can be achieved. It is envisaged that the  controls will be established through a consultative process and implemented through  policy, standards and architecture, thereby allowing operations to proceed, provided  that they are undertaken within established parameters.        E. Assessment of the risks, benefits and costs of separating the  strategic, policymaking and compliance functions      9.  The proposal for two departments serving all Secretariat entities is based on the  sound management principles of unity of command and purpose; clarity of roles and  responsibilities; and empowered delegations of authority that are rational, holistic and  decentralized as far as possible within an established risk framework, in which risk  assessment is supported by analytics and individual oversight data and the exercise  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  204/246    of delegated authority is supported, monitored and designed so that form follows  function. Strategy, policy and accountability functions will be separated from  operations enabler functions. The two departments will serve all entities with  dedicated support in the areas of strategy, policy and compliance, on the one hand,  and operational and transactional services on the other.   10. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance structure will  provide the Secretary-General with not only global best practices in management  strategy and policy but also the oversight necessary to ensure that the delegation of  authority framework is functioning as it should and that the support structures are  delivering the field orientation, client friendliness and agile and nimble services that  the Secretary-General intends to institute.   11.  The Department of Operational Support will serve as the primary client-facing  department, enabling operations by providing guidance and advisory services,  assistance to client entities where capacity may be weak or non-existent, capacity- building, process and enterprise system improvements, operational performance  reviews to improve operational performance and support services to the entire  Secretariat.        Benefits    12. In creating the two departments, the Secretary-General wishes to ensure  improved service delivery, in particular with regard to the entire field architecture.  Analysis conducted by the internal review team on management reform and  subsequently confirmed by the work of the departments has shown that the two- department structure should be retained, albeit with a different division of  responsibilities, one focused on global operations support that is counterbalanced  with a dedicated function focused on governance, accountability, transparency and  quality assurance.  13. Establishing the two proposed departments is expected to yield the overall  benefit of ensuring fast and effective services by, wherever possible, empowering  action and decision-making closer to the point of delivery, based on the rationale that  front-line senior managers are better informed of the ground realities and  requirements for delivery of programme outcomes and mandates than centralized  management. Decentralization of management authority and responsibilities to senior  managers will contribute to addressing the challenges identified in resource  management that have an impact on programme and mandate delivery and enable fair  and full accountability for results. Underpinning this decentralization and alignment  of responsibilities and accountabilities will be strengthened, streamlined and  simplified policies and procedures, clear and segregated roles and responsibilities,  mainstreamed risk management that balances operational and managerial risk, and  information technology and communications infrastructure and capacities that  support sound decision-making and action and enable real-time and transparent  business analytics and monitoring under a robust accountability framework.   14. Once the two departments are established and operational, existing duplication  of effort and identified inefficiencies caused by multiple handover points are expected  to liberate resources to take on the required overarching and strategic issues.        Specific benefits    15. Specific benefits of establishing the two departments include:    (a)  Elimination of overlap in responsibilities between the two departments:  decentralization and elimination of overlap will allow the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance to focus its resources on establishing strategies,    A/72/492/Add.2    205/246  18-04386    developing policies and establishing accountability and compliance frameworks for  the Organization with effective monitoring systems. The Department of Operational  Support, for its part, will be able to focus on operational support and on providing  dedicated advisory services to managers in entities to ensure robust and accountable  decision-making in compliance with rules and regulations;    (b)  Increased efficiency and speed in decision-making at the entity level in  line with immediate operational demands;    (c)  Streamlined policies that will remove unnecessary complexity and  introduce the clarity required to enable prompt and effective action;    (d)  More flexibility in the rules and policies that will account for vastly  different operational environments and tempos across the global Secretariat.        Risks    16. Greater integration, clear linkages, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and  improved governance are required for the new paradigm to improve mandate delivery  and enhance accountability. Also required is the strengthening or development of a  robust delegation of authority framework underpinned by the required streamlined  policy framework, capacity-building where necessary, business intelligence and  analysis to support monitoring and quality assurance, and a risk management  framework that balances operational and managerial risk. Such capacities and tools  are currently lacking in the two existing departments. The two new departments will  need to be carefully engineered in order to ensure that these requirements are met and  reflected in their structures and working methods.   17. In this regard, in order to ensure integration and unity of effort towards meeting  the goals of policy consistency, accountability and operational support effectiveness,  the Executive Senior Management Committee, co-chaired by the Under-Secretaries- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and for Operational  Support, will be established. Serving as a platform for interdepartmental coordination,  the Committee will bring together, on a regular basis, the senior management of both  departments and identify and address cross-departmental priorities and strategic  issues, including those related to the efficient and effective delivery of services to  clients.  18. The establishment of the Management Client Board provides a further standing  mechanism to ensure that feedback from the different types of client entities across  the Secretariat is systematically provided and that their particular concerns and  requirements are taken into account by both departments. Where an operational need  is identified, the Board will also feed policymaking processes.         Costs    19. The Secretary General has confirmed that the management reform proposal is  not intended as a cost-cutting exercise and that the implementation of the reform  proposals is intended to be cost-neutral. Both departments have taken on additional  work over the past years, for example the roll-out of Umoja, and have been operating  on a ""do more with less"" approach. As a result, the scope for further reducing costs is  being increasingly compromised.       A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  206/246      F. Assessment and lessons learned from the restructuring of the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of  the Department of Field Support      20. Shortly after taking office, the former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon sent a  letter to the President of the General Assembly on sustaining the capacity of the  Organization to manage and sustain peace operations (A/61/749). The letter drew  attention to the fact that the existing structure in the Secretariat to support  peacekeeping operations was not sufficient to meet the demand for and complexity of  peacekeeping operations. The letter indicated that measures ""to better align authority,  responsibilities and resources ... with a view to facilitating clearer performance  accountability"" would lead to ""better planning, faster deployment and a more  responsive system of support"" and ""would also lead to the more effective, efficient  and transparent use of resources placed by Member States at the Secretariat's disposal  to implement legislative mandates"".   21. In its resolution 61/279, the General Assembly endorsed most of the  recommendations of the Secretary-General (see A/61/858, A/61/858/Corr.1,  A/61/858/Add.1, A/61/858/Add.1/Corr.1 and A/61/858/Add.2) and established the  Department of Field Support. However, more than 10 years after the restructuring of  the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the Department  of Field Support, most of the concerns that prompted the submission of the letter  remain valid at present. This is why the Secretary-General proposed a shift in the  management paradigm in the Secretariat and why the present comprehensive report  has been submitted.   22. Two reports on the implementation of resolution 61/279 (A/62/741, A/63/702  and A/63/702/Corr.1) were submitted to the General Assembly, as were the results of  an audit by the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the structure for managing  and sustaining peacekeeping operations (A/63/837). However, as acknowledged by  the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in 2009,  insufficient time had elapsed for these efforts to have yielded a meaningful  assessment of the impact of the restructuring.   23. In retrospect, there are many reasons for the promise of the restructuring not  being fully met, of which three have had lasting repercussions. The first is the fact  that the proposal was not fully approved; the General Assembly deferred  consideration of the proposed transfer of responsibility and resources for field  procurement from the Department of Management to the Department of Field  Support. However, the present report provides a proposal on how to implement an  integrated supply chain within one department while maintaining the necessary  segregation of duties and safeguards. The present report proposes that both logistics  and procurement be located within the new Office of Supply Chain Management,  therefore allowing for much closer coordination between the two functions in the  sourcing process and eliminating the bureaucratic delays currently experienced when  processes cross departmental lines, all while maintaining the requisite segregation of  duties. Further safeguards are also available through technical role mapping in  Umoja, functionality that was not available when the Department of Field Support  was established. This allows for a much more responsive approach to the delivery of  goods and services while still protecting against waste, fraud and abuse.   24. Second, while many weaknesses were identified in the system of delegation of  authority, most of the steps taken did not address the fragmentation or inconsistencies  in how authority was delegated to different parts of the system. Instead, efforts taken  by the Secretariat were focused on formalizing the existing process of delegation of  authority, including through the promulgation of administrative issuances on the    A/72/492/Add.2    207/246  18-04386    delegation of authority under the Financial Regulations and Rules and Staff  Regulations and Rules. These measures alone have not been sufficient to address  certain weaknesses in the delegations, as evidenced through observations of the Board  of Auditors related to delegation of procurement authority in its report for the year  ended 31 December 2016 (A/72/5 (Vol. I) and A/72/5 (Vol. I)/Corr.1) and delegation  of authority for peacekeeping operations in its report on United Nations peacekeeping  operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 (A/72/5 (Vol. II)).  25. Third, restructuring and delegation of authority are themselves necessary but  not sufficient to improve the effective and accountable delivery of mandates. These  processes must be accompanied by the associated overhaul of administrative policies  and procedures. During an audit by the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the  management structures of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations prior to the  restructuring in 2007, the Department and many missions indicated that certain rules  and procedures ""were outdated, were too rigid and did not correspond to the current  field realities in peacekeeping missions"" (A/61/743, para. 30). However, no  meaningful review of rules and procedures was conducted following the adoption of  resolution 61/279, and the same concerns regarding the existing policy framework  have been regularly raised, including in the audit by the Office of Internal Oversight  Services following the restructuring (see A/63/837), by the High-level Independent  Panel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95-S/2015/446) and by Member States and staff  of all levels during the consultations convened in early 2017 by the internal review  team on management reform.   26. The current reform initiative builds on the lessons learned from both the  restructuring exercise itself and the past decade's worth of experience with delivery  of services to peace operations by a dedicated support entity, the Department of Field  Support. While one of the three challenges listed above is not within the ability of the  Secretariat to address, the other two, namely the challenges of delegation and the  overhaul of policies, are explicitly being addressed as part of the reforms. The  paradigm shift towards a decentralized Secretariat, where responsibility is aligned  with authority and management of resources, requires a restructuring of the  Secretariat to ensure that the management architecture has dedicated capacities  focusing on the objectives of improved effectiveness and enhanced accountability,  which are prerequisites for direct delegation. It also requires a parallel effort to ensure  that the overall policy framework is rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate the new  paradigm. As indicated in the first report of the Secretary-General on management  reform, a review and simplification of human resources policies and procedures will  be completed in 2018, and progress will be reported to the General Assembly during  the main part of its seventy-third session. Finally, strong leadership is also required  to help to implement a culture shift in the Organization. The management reform can  realize its full potential only if all elements are in place.   27. The proposed structure of the new management architecture also builds on best  practices identified as part of the 2007 restructuring. One of the fundamental reasons  for the proposal to move the Office of Mission Support out of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations and to upgrade it to a department was a concern over the  problem of managerial overstretching and a recognition of the need for greater clarity  of departmental roles and responsibilities. Subsequent reviews concluded that the  establishment of the Department of Field Support both recognized the criticality of  support issues in the success of missions and allowed the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations to focus on substantive peacekeeping issues. Consequently, the proposed  restructuring of the management architecture also takes into consideration concerns  regarding entrusting any single department with too broad and unmanageable a span  of control. It also benefits from specialization and a clear division of roles and  responsibilities to prepare the Organization to meet future challenges.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/72/773      General Assembly    Distr.: General  1 March 2018    Original: English    18-03255 (E)    180418  *1803255*      Seventy-second session  Agenda item 134  Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations           Seventh progress report on the accountability system in  the United Nations Secretariat: strengthening the  accountability system of the Secretariat under the new  management paradigm         Report of the Secretary-General         Summary    The Secretary-General has the honour to submit to the General Assembly a report  on progress made towards the implementation of the accountability system in the  United Nations Secretariat, as requested by the Assembly in its resolution 71/283. The  report comprises two main parts. The first part provides an update on the progress  made in strengthening the accountability system over the past year, including:  (a) defining the leadership framework of the United Nations Chief Executives Board  for Coordination; (b) promulgating an enhanced whistle-blower protection policy;  (c) instituting special measures for combating sexual exploitation and abuse;  (d) preventing and responding to sexual harassment; and (e) conducting a fraud and  corruption risk assessment.    The second part of the report explains how the Secretary-General intends to  strengthen the Secretariat's accountability system to support his proposed new  management paradigm, under which greater authority will be delegated to managers  entrusted with the responsibility to deliver on the Organization's mandates, who in  turn will be held accountable for their decisions, performance and conduct. It  introduces a ""three lines of defence"" model, which will clarify essential roles and  responsibilities for risk management and internal controls within the Organization and  improve the effectiveness of the risk management systems. The model is in line with  the overall objective of the management reform efforts and is aimed at enhancing the  effectiveness of the Organization in meeting its mandates and ensuring the effective  use of resources.  A/72/773      18-03255  2/42      The Secretary-General is also using this opportunity to present, in annex I, a  summary of the updated version of the Secretariat's accountability system, including  the new additions that have been incorporated since it was first introduced in the report  entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/64/640), as well as those new elements that are being created in the context of the  proposed management reform. The updated system will be the basis for the preparation  of global accountability guidance that will clearly articulate to staff and managers what  those components are, how the accountability mechanisms fit together and how they  interrelate, thereby enabling managers and staff to discharge their responsibilities in  an informed and responsible manner and to be held accountable for their actions and  decisions. Annex II to the present report includes an action plan for the implementation  of results-based management at the United Nations Secretariat during the period 2018- 2021.            A/72/773    3/42  18-03255      I. Introduction      1.  In his report dated 27 September 2017, entitled ""Shifting the management  paradigm in the United Nations: ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492 and  A/72/492/Add.1), the Secretary-General stressed his commitment to strengthening  the culture of accountability within the Secretariat. Under the proposed new  management paradigm, decision-making will be decentralized by bringing it closer to  the point of delivery. Bureaucracy will be reduced and policies will be streamlined  and simplified. Support and service delivery to departments, regional commissions,  offices away from Headquarters and field missions will be improved. Changes to  management and support structures to better support the delivery of programmes and  provide managers with quality assurance and strategic policy guidance will be  submitted to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed seventy-second  session.   2.  The Secretary-General will delegate authority to senior managers for the use of  resources to support programme delivery and mandate implementation. It will not be  a blanket delegation of authority, but rather will be done on the basis of careful  consideration of the capacity of the managers to receive such authority and their  ability to properly execute it. Training and support will be provided with regard to the  proper use of that delegated authority. The institution as a whole, and its individual  staff members, will be held accountable for delivering agreed results while complying  with regulations, rules and ethical standards. Staff members will also be expected to  proactively identify and manage risks that threaten the achievement of their  objectives. Performance, both programmatic and managerial, will be systematically  monitored, evaluated and reported. Programme managers will take corrective actions  in order to keep plans on track, and lessons learned will be used to inform future  planning. Programme planning and performance information will be updated and  reported to Member States on an annual basis, in the context of the proposed annual  programme budget document. In addition, the programmatic and financial  performance of individual programmes will be reflected on dashboards, which will  be updated quarterly. The dashboards will be accessible to Member States and staff.  The present report describes how the accountability system is being strengthened to  support, and align with, the proposed management reforms.        II. Recent actions taken to strengthen the accountability system  in the United Nations Secretariat      3.  Since the beginning of his tenure, the Secretary-General has taken a number of  actions to strengthen the culture of accountability in the Secretariat. Some of those  measures build on gains made by the Organization through previous reform processes,  while others are new initiatives. What follows is a brief description of those efforts.        Leadership framework for the United Nations System Chief Executives Board  for Coordination    4.  The reports of the Secretary-General entitled ""Investing in the United Nations:  for  a  stronger  Organization  worldwide""  (A/60/692, A/60/692/Corr.1  and  A/60/692/Corr.2) and ""Investing in people"" (A/61/255, A/61/255/Add.1 and  A/61/255/Add.1/Corr.1) identified the need to better support and develop the  leadership and management culture of the United Nations. Some steps taken towards  that goal include the introduction of compacts between the Secretary-General and  senior managers as a strategic management tool, dedicating capacity within the  Department of Field Support to recruit and provide support to senior managers in field  A/72/773      18-03255  4/42    missions and the development of induction and mentoring programmes, and  mandatory training programmes for senior leadership.   5.  In his report dated 27 September 2017, the Secretary-General stated that the  United Nations must work across organizational boundaries, harnessing the full  power of its available resources, capacities and partnerships, if the Organization was  to truly lead. Critical to its success would be a profound transformation of culture,  and visionary and principled United Nations leadership -- at all levels and across the  system. A leadership that would communicate the Organization's vision to all  stakeholders and was emboldened and took decisions, and was accountable for them,  and recognized problems and acted promptly to solve them.  6.  Those characteristics are embedded in the United Nations system leadership  framework, as endorsed by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for  Coordination (CEB). As explained in the report of the Secretary-General dated  27 September 2017, the new leadership framework sets out eight defining  characteristics determined to be essential to fulfilling the Organization's core  mandate to promote peace and security, protect human rights, address humanitarian  needs and advance the imperatives of economic and social progress set out in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development.  7.  The eight principles defining United Nations leadership are that it is:  (a) principled, defending the  Organization's  values,  norms and standards;  (b) norm-based, grounded in United Nations values and standards; (c) inclusive;  (d) accountable, demonstrating 360-degree accountability within the United Nations,  across the United Nations system, to Member States and to those served by the  Organization; (e) multidimensional, integrating across organizational boundaries and  functions; (f) transformational, achieving positive change; (g) collaborative; and  (h) self-applied, exhibiting the principles in all interactions. To those, the Secretary- General has added a ninth characteristic: that it is pragmatic and action-oriented, taking  principled and practical action to deliver on mandates, balancing administrative and  operational risks and erring on the side of action to prevent and address human  suffering.  8.  The leadership framework is being operationalized through the senior managers'  compacts in 2018 and will be integrated into all leadership and management staff  selection decisions at all levels across the Secretariat. In addition, the Secretariat  intends to revitalize and update leadership orientation, training, mentoring and  coaching to reflect the framework. The Organization is developing a 360-degree  evaluation mechanism around those nine qualities and is conducting staff surveys to  monitor staff perceptions of their leadership and managers. A pilot exercise was  launched in 2017 whereby a few senior managers at Headquarters and field operations  underwent 360-degree reviews. Following an assessment conducted by the  Department of Management, an appropriate 360-degree feedback evaluation model  for senior leaders was recently proposed for the consideration of the Secretary- General and is expected to be rolled out in 2018. Responses from senior leadership  will be sought following the roll out of the 360-degree feedback evaluation, and  lessons learned will be incorporated into the subsequent implementation of the  360-degree feedback evaluations for middle management and lower levels.         Strengthened whistle-blower protection policy    9.  The Secretary-General is committed to ensuring an environment in which staff  feel safe to report wrongdoing and to protecting them against retaliation when they  do. That is an important part of any anti-fraud and anti-corruption framework. Staff  and other United Nations personnel at all levels are commonly the first to recognize  wrongdoing in the workplace; therefore, empowering them to speak up without fear    A/72/773    5/42  18-03255    of reprisal will help prevent, detect, deter, respond to and enable reporting on fraud  and corruption.  10. A significantly strengthened policy on protection against retaliation for  reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits or  investigations (ST/SGB/2017/2) was promulgated on 20 January 2017, and a revised  policy went into effect on 28 November 2017 (ST/SGB/2017/2/Rev.1). The revised  policy allows the Ethics Office to recommend preventive action where a risk of  retaliation has been identified by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). It  affords protection from retaliation to individual contractors and consultants and to  United Nations staff who report wrongdoing committed not only by other staff but  also by contractors, non-United Nations peacekeepers and others. The policy also  allows for the possibility of transferring the retaliator (as opposed to the complainant)  to another office after an investigation. In addition, staff now have the right to seek a  review of the determinations of the Ethics Office and to be notified of disciplinary  measures taken against staff members found to have retaliated against them. The  terms and implementation of the policy will be reviewed annually.        Secretariat-wide fraud and corruption risk assessment     11.  Following the issuance of the first-ever Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption  Framework for the United Nations Secretariat (ST/IC/2016/25), the Secretariat  conducted a fraud and corruption risk assessment to identify the most critical areas at  risk of fraud and corruption in order to design a comprehensive anti-fraud and  anti-corruption strategy and implement the proper mitigation measures, thereby  addressing a long-standing concern of the Board of Auditors that the Secretariat had  not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment regarding fraud.  12. The exercise was based on a review of available historical data and losses  suffered by the Secretariat and an extensive series of interviews and workshops held  across the entire Secretariat, including consultations with the oversight bodies. It was  approved by the Management Committee, acting in its capacity as the enterprise risk  management committee of the Secretariat.   13. Six critical areas of risks were identified: (a) organizational culture and  accountability; (b) information and communications technology governance and  cybersecurity; (c) the Umoja system control environment; (d) implementing partners;  (e) theft of fuel, rations and inventory; and (f) procurement.  14. Corporate risk owners were assigned and tasked with the responsibility of  developing detailed risk treatment and response plans for those priority risks, which  will outline specific risk treatment actions to further mitigate risks and set timelines  for their implementation.  15. Going forward, the Management Committee will periodically consider progress  on the implementation of the agreed mitigating actions and the overall exposure of  the Secretariat to fraud and corruption risks.  16. That exercise will be the starting point for heads of departments, missions and  offices to apply results to the local conditions and implement required measures at  the local level.         Strengthening protection against sexual exploitation and abuse    17. In his first major report on the topic for 2017 (A/71/818, A/71/818/Corr.1 and  A/71/818/Add.1), the Secretary-General set out a four-pronged strategy to prevent  and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse committed by those serving under the  United Nations flag: (a) putting the rights and dignity of victims at the forefront of  United Nations efforts; (b) ending impunity for those guilty of sexual exploitation and  A/72/773      18-03255  6/42    abuse; (c) building a multi-stakeholder network to support the strategy; and  (d) increasing transparency about the issue and raising awareness of this abhorrent  conduct worldwide. He appointed a victims' rights advocate to work with all parts of  the United Nations system, Member States, civil society and other stakeholders to  support, in collaboration with field victims' rights advocates in four United Nations  missions, an integrated policy response to victims' assistance and accountability. The  Secretary-General also invited Heads of State and Government to join a circle of  leadership on the prevention of and response to sexual exploitation and abuse in  United Nations operations to demonstrate their commitment to work in partnership to  prevent such conduct and respond robustly if it occurs.  18. The Secretary-General also crafted, in cooperation with Member States, a  voluntary compact which identifies concrete prevention and response actions,  including elevating the interests of victims. He addressed the accountability of the  United Nations with respect to its authority by strengthening mechanisms to  encourage the reporting of allegations; mainstreamed discussion of sexual  exploitation and abuse through the Leadership Dialogues and the issuance of ""no  excuse"" cards to personnel of all entities operating in high-risk field locations; and  called on all United Nations leaders to certify that their entities reported all credible  allegations received. He demanded that all entities maintain data on reports of alleged  sexual exploitation and abuse in situations where there was sufficient information to  suggest the occurrence of such conduct against an identifiable or identified victim,  and that they submit that data on a quarterly basis, and since November 2017 has  made those reports public through his spokesperson. He also spearheaded the  development of a screening tool that will prohibit the rehiring of United Nations  personnel subject to a substantiated allegation by another part of the Organization.  19. Given the higher risk of sexual exploitation and abuse in field missions, the  Department of Field Support strengthened the ability of peacekeeping and special  political missions to manage that risk through the development of a new sexual  exploitation and abuse risk management toolkit that provides missions with a  systematic approach to identifying, assessing and mitigating risks relating to sexual  exploitation and abuse. The toolkit uses standardized measurement references that are  aligned with other risk management processes for peacekeeping missions, and is  designed to be adaptable to specific mission conditions. The toolkit will be piloted in  the field in the first half of 2018 and, on the basis of lessons learned from the pilot  exercise, will be finalized and launched later in 2018.        Combating sexual harassment     20. Addressing sexual harassment in the United Nations Secretariat, and in the  system as a whole, is equally an Organizational priority for the Secretary-General and  a critical element of the broader vision of advancing gender parity and the  empowerment of women within the Organization. The Secretary-General has  repeatedly emphasized his commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to sexual  harassment in the workplace, including through a joint letter with staff unions that  encouraged staff members to support victims and witnesses and reminded them of the  available reporting mechanisms.  21. A wide variety of concrete and immediate actions are being undertaken to ensure  that staff and other personnel who have been either targets of sexual harassment or  bystanders feel safe and empowered to speak up, and that appropriate mechanisms  are in place to prevent, investigate and respond to such incidents and provide  protection for victims and witnesses.  22. The revision of the policy on investigations and disciplinary processes  (ST/AI/2017/1) and the strengthening of the whistle-blower policy protecting staff    A/72/773    7/42  18-03255    members from retaliation have enhanced the normative framework for staff members.  The Secretary-General has mobilized senior managers to improve guidance,  information and services for staff, with an emphasis on improving support for victims.  Those measures include a 24-hour helpline in the Secretariat so staff are able to access  information and confidential support, an updated mandatory training programme on  the prevention of sexual harassment and abuse and an information note on available  reporting mechanisms and services. Information on all those measures is readily  accessible through a new dedicated intranet page.  23. As sexual harassment is often underreported, a Secretariat staff survey is being  developed to better understand the prevalence, nature and experience of sexual  harassment. The survey will facilitate and strengthen the Organization's ability to  respond effectively and quickly. Efforts are also under way to strengthen investigation  and response capacities. OIOS is implementing a streamlined, fast-tracked procedure  to receive, process and address all sexual harassment complaints. A specialized team  focusing on investigations is being created, and additional investigators are under  recruitment. Particular attention is being given to increasing the number of  investigators who are women.  24. To accelerate action across the United Nations system, in November 2017 the  Secretary-General created a CEB task force on addressing sexual harassment tasked  with reviewing sexual harassment policies, investigative capacities and victims'  protection and support mechanisms across the United Nations system. Chaired by the  Under-Secretary-General for Management in her role as Chair of the High-level  Committee on Management, the task force is focusing on improving system-wide data  collection and prevention and response efforts. It has established thematic working  groups on policy, reporting, investigative capacity, communication and leveraging  innovation. The task force will present its findings and recommendations to the High- level Committee on Management and CEB in May 2018.        Performance incentives, remedial action and sanctions    25. The Secretary-General is committed to implementing an effective system of  incentives for strong performance, remedial action for underperformance and  sanctions for unsatisfactory behaviour and misconduct.   26. In terms of incentives, the General Assembly, in its resolution 70/244, requested  the International Civil Service Commission to conduct studies on the performance  management schemes in common system organizations and to formulate  recommendations on performance incentives. During the seventy-second session of  the Assembly, the Commission presented, in its annual report, the results of the  requested studies along with recommendations, including a set of principles and  guidelines for performance appraisal and management for the recognition of different  levels of performance (see A/72/30, para. 65, and annex VI). Following the adoption  of resolution 72/255, in which the Assembly approved the Commission's proposed  principles and guidelines, they will be reflected in the ongoing review of the  performance management system of the Secretariat, which will include consultations  with staff representatives.  27. The Secretariat will develop a knowledge management system that includes case  studies containing examples of corrective actions and potential sanctions taken with  regard to cases of poor performance and poor management of delegated authority.  The knowledge management system will function as a reference point to guide senior  officials and those who have received delegations of authority from senior officials.  It will demonstrate how delegation can be withdrawn or other sanctions imposed  (e.g., lateral moves out of functions, termination and so on). In addition, the  A/72/773      18-03255  8/42    knowledge management system will also contain cases of positive examples where  managers appropriately applied their delegations of authority.   28. The Secretariat expects to complete its work on incentives, remedial action and  sanctions as soon as possible, subject to the staff-management consultative process,  and to report on the results in a future accountability report.        International Public Sector Accounting Standards and Umoja: important  enablers for strengthening accountability    29. The implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards  (IPSAS) and the Umoja enterprise resource planning system underpin the  management reform proposal of the Secretary-General. Those two important business  transformation initiatives individually and collectively strengthen the accountability  framework by enhancing visibility in operations in terms of breadth and depth of  information and by providing higher-quality information for the planning and  implementation of activities and the better measurement of results.         International Public Sector Accounting Standards    30. The adoption of IPSAS by the United Nations introduced accrual accounting,  which allows the Organization to report its results on a consistent and comparable  basis, providing benchmarking opportunities with other United Nations system and  public-sector organizations. In addition, the preparation of the financial reports under  IPSAS provides a clearer picture of the Organization's assets and liabilities (such as  employee salaries and benefits), and allows all stakeholders to have a more  comprehensive view of the Organization's financial position, performance and cash  flows and a better assessment of how well the United Nations has used its available  resources.   31. The high-quality financial reporting generated by IPSAS also requires more  financial transactions to be recognized or disclosed either in financial statements or  in notes to financial statements (on items such as inventory, intangible assets and  accounts payable) and the preparation of yearly financial statements and yearly  comprehensive audits by the Board of Auditors. All of those factors lead to better  governance, management and transparency and enhance the ability of the United  Nations independent assurance functions, as well as Member States, to exercise their  oversight responsibilities and hold the Organization accountable.        Umoja enterprise resource planning system    32. The implementation of the full scope of Umoja (Foundation and Extensions 1  and 2) will transform the most important managerial spheres of the Organization's  operations, providing stakeholders with an integrated and detailed view of the overall  performance of the Organization, illustrating the dependencies among its units and  how their individual performance is affecting the overall performance of the  Organization.   33. Umoja already covers a very broad range of functionality. In addition, a more  integrated and complete picture of the Organization's performance, rather than a  fragmented view produced by the numerous legacy information sources, will make  the financial situation and performance of the Organization more transparent. The  introduction of Umoja Extension 2, which will deal with strategic planning and  performance management, in September 2018 will provide a qualitatively significant  improvement in accountability for delivering results and resolve a long-standing gap  with regard to providing tools to programme managers for proactively managing  programme performance. It will also facilitate timely interventions for corrective  measures and improve the effectiveness of the risk management process. In that    A/72/773    9/42  18-03255    regard, the Board of Auditors has recognized the attainment of global Umoja  deployment as a major achievement, as the system introduces a step change in  technology, and is of the opinion that Umoja continues to represent a unique  opportunity to drive more cost-effective delivery of mandates by increasing the  operational effectiveness of administrative functions through modern, improved ways  of working and improved decision-making through the exploitation of better  management information (see A/70/158, para. 18).  34. Umoja is also an important enabler of the Secretariat's global service delivery  model, which will increase the Secretariat's efficiency through specialization and  location-agnostic delivery and by concentrating an entire series of transactional  functions in a service centre. It will also promote a consistent interpretation and  application of all regulations, rules, policies and principles related to the management  of resources, thereby reducing reputational and financial risks to the Organization.  35. Through sophisticated data analytics, very large volumes of data can be analysed  quickly and periodically to measure and monitor performance relating to every  process supported by Umoja. Umoja also has tools to monitor the performance of  individuals in terms of how they use the system. The platform is allowing the  Secretariat to perform data mining, which increases the abilities of the Organization  to uncover systemic problems, previously hidden patterns, correlations, trends and  other useful information that will assist it in making better-informed business  decisions and which will undoubtedly lead to improved efficiency. Umoja is also  strengthening the capabilities of auditors by enabling them to analyse not only  samples of the population, but data pertaining to the entire population, if required.   36. Finally, the implementation of the full scope of Umoja will improve the  implementation of results-based management by strengthening the link between  results and the utilization of resources and by providing managers with better tools to  proactively manage programme delivery. Programme and financial performance  information will be displayed on dashboards which will be rolled out starting in early  2019.        III. Strengthening the accountability system of the Secretariat  under the new management paradigm          New functions and processes for increased accountability in the context of a  new management paradigm    37. As stated in his report dated 27 September 2017, the Secretary-General is  proposing to the General Assembly a new management paradigm that will empower  managers to determine how best to use their resources to support programme delivery  and mandate implementation. To effect that change, the Secretary-General intends to  delegate directly to the heads of entities across the Secretariat the authorities needed  for the effective stewardship of their resources. Those authorities will be aligned with  responsibilities to ensure the chain of command from the Secretary-General to senior  officials and below while also holding them accountable for the programmatic and  financial performance of their programmes.   38. Under the new paradigm, decision-making will be decentralized by bringing it  closer to the point of delivery. Bureaucracy will be reduced and policies will be  streamlined and simplified. Support and service delivery to departments, regional  commissions, offices away from Headquarters and field missions will be improved.  Proposed changes to management and support structures to better support the delivery  of programmes and provide managers with quality assurance and strategic policy  A/72/773      18-03255  10/42    guidance will be submitted to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed  seventy-second session.   39. The scope of the delegation of the Secretary-General's authority to senior  managers will not be a blanket delegation, but rather will be made on the basis of  careful consideration of the capacity of the managers to receive such authority and  their ability to properly execute it.   40. The delegation of authority will be accompanied by complementary  management reforms that include a simplification and streamlining of the rules,  policies and procedures and the creation of new, clear and simplified policies and  administrative guidance, accompanied by appropriate training, support, monitoring  and accountability mechanisms. A new performance monitoring and compliance  function will assess the conformity of the Organization's operations in accordance  with the internal control system and the best practices applicable to the Secretariat's  business processes. Those new functions will also ensure greater transparency and  accountability.  41. The new components of the Secretariat's accountability system, the  enhancement of existing processes, practices and procedures and the introduction of  the new compliance functions, which will be described in detail in the remainder of  the report, include the following:    (a)  Updating  the  Secretariat's  accountability  system and preparing  management accountability guidance that explains the Secretariat's accountability  system in language that is clearly understandable to all staff. The guidance will  include information on the Organization's values, principles, structures, processes  and policies, thereby enabling managers and staff at all levels to discharge their  responsibilities in an informed and responsible manner and to be held accountable for  their actions and decisions;    (b)  Strengthening the implementation of results-based management to refocus  the efforts of staff at all levels towards the achievement of the Organization's  objectives and results, and defining a four-year action plan towards that end;    (c)  Placing a stronger emphasis on the ""three lines of defence"" model to  enhance clarity regarding risks and controls and assist in improving the effectiveness  of the risk management systems;    (d)  Strengthening the senior managers' compact system to more effectively  assess the performance of the Organization's senior managers;    (e)  Adopting a statement of internal control that will be signed by all senior  managers;    (f)  Creating an improved and streamlined system of delegation of authority  that clearly delineates authorities and responsibilities in an accountability matrix;    (g)  Developing a new set of monitoring and compliance functions that  includes:    (i)  Enhanced guidance and support for the delegation of authority and more  systematic and frequent monitoring of the use of delegated authority and the  segregation of duties;    (ii) Monitoring performance and compliance through data analytics,  introducing  programme  performance  dashboards  and  strengthening  self-evaluation activities and reporting;    (iii) Systematically conducting management reviews and quality assurance  exercises.    A/72/773    11/42  18-03255        Global management accountability guidance     42. The principles of accountability have always been embedded in the structures  and policies of the United Nations Secretariat.   43. Having considered several reports of the Secretary-General on the subject,  including the report entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United Nations  Secretariat"" (A/64/640), Member States agreed on a definition of accountability for  the United Nations and, embedded in that definition, the components of the  Secretariat's accountability system.  44. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 64/259, the General Assembly defined  accountability for the United Nations as:     The obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be answerable for all  decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be responsible for honouring  their commitments, without qualification or exception.     Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a timely  and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all mandates  to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies and  other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and  resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of  rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important role of the  oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted recommendations.  45. That definition includes the six components that are at the core of the  Secretariat's accountability system: (a) the Charter of the United Nations; (b) the  programme planning and budgetary documents of the Organization; (c) results and  performance; (d) the internal control system; (e) ethical standards and integrity; and  (e) the oversight functions. The steps to accountability are presented in figure I.      A/72/773      18-03255  12/42        Figure I      Steps to accountability      A/72/773    13/42  18-03255    46. As the objectives, standards and processes of the United Nations have evolved  over time, strengthening the accountability system and the internal control framework  of the Secretariat has been a continuous process. For example, in recent years the  Secretariat has, inter alia, established an Ethics Office, instituted a financial  disclosure programme, developed senior manager compacts, adopted enterprise risk  management and implemented a phased approach to results-based management.  Those efforts have been reflected in annual progress reports on accountability that  have been presented to the General Assembly since 2010.  47. The Secretary-General now wishes to clearly articulate and integrate each of  those components into a system that conveys to every staff member the Secretariat's  expectations for conduct, sound performance and efficient management practices.  Moreover, it is important to align the Secretariat's accountability structures to the  new management paradigm proposed by the Secretary-General. Efforts are under way  to streamline and simplify the internal policy framework to better support decision- making, as well as to increase transparency by introducing dashboards and other tools  to report on the use of resources and the progress made in programme delivery  throughout the year.   48. A chart of the updated accountability system is shown in figure II, and the  summarized version of the Secretariat's accountability system is included as annex I  to the present report.      A/72/773      18-03255  14/42    Figure II   Accountability system of the United Nations Secretariat: its components and interactions       * External oversight bodies that provide independent assurance to the General Assembly.    How do these components interact with each other? The Charter is the foundational document of the United Nations and enshrines its  basic principles, purposes and organs. Member States issue mandates, expressed as directives, priorities and targets, and the  Secretary-General is responsible for implementing those mandates and for reporting on outcomes and the resources used. In  discharging his responsibilities, the Secretary-General is obliged to reflect those mandates in the programme budget and the  peacekeeping budgets. Programme managers and individual staff members are obliged to prepare their respective workplans with the  purpose of achieving the results established therein. During that process, the Secretariat must continuously monitor performa nce,  adjust implementation where needed, conduct ongoing evaluations and use evaluation findings for improvement and learning.    A/72/773    15/42  18-03255    49. The Secretariat will prepare comprehensive guidance, formulated in accordance  with global best practices and including hyperlinks directing the user to the original  source of information, to provide staff with direction and guidance for all aspects of  the Secretariat's accountability structures and operations. It will be clearly written,  easy to understand and updated on a continuous basis. The guidance will also be used  in the induction training provided for newly recruited staff, including senior  leadership. In the past, key elements of accountability have been included in the  induction training, but for the first-time new staff at all levels will receive  comprehensive guidance on the full accountability system.   50. Strengthening the accountability system and the internal controls in an  Organization as complex as the United Nations and in a rapidly changing world must  necessarily be a continuous process.         Strengthening the implementation of results-based management         Conceptual framework for results-based management    51. As requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/259, the Secretary- General, in his second progress report on the accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat (A/67/714), presented a conceptual framework for results-based  management in the Secretariat, as well as a governance structure for that purpose. The  report used the following definition of results-based management: a broad  management approach that uses information about expected results for strategic  planning,  human  resources  and  budgetary  decision-making,  performance  measurement and learning. That definition links the overall strategic objectives, plans  and budgets of the Organization with human resources management, integrating the  senior managers' compacts and the Performance Management and Development  System for staff at levels below the level of Assistant Secretary-General.  52. In the context of that definition, results-based management is viewed by the  Secretariat as an integrated approach meant to ensure that the processes, outputs and  services of the Organization all have the goal of achieving results. Under the strategy,  the delivery of results (results and outputs) guides the Secretariat's planning,  budgeting, monitoring and reporting. Those processes are further informed by  systematic evaluations and lessons learned, which are fed back into the planning and  budgeting processes to improve the performance of the Organization, and to define  human resources strategies that are directly linked to the objectives of the  Organization.        Strengthening the implementation of results-based management    53. Taking into consideration the decisions of Member States and the findings and  recommendations of the oversight bodies related to results-based management,1 the  Secretary-General has identified strengthening the implementation of results-based  management in the Secretariat, and holding managers and staff accountable for the  delivery of results, as critical aspects for shifting the management paradigm. The  renewed focus on results is emphasized in paragraph 57 of the report of the Secretary- General dated 27 September 2017, in which he states that the Secretariat must redirect  the efforts of staff at all levels towards the achievement of the Organization's  objectives and goals and shift the focus of the Secretariat's efforts from inputs and  activities to results and outcomes, and that the results will inform decision-making  through the whole planning, budgeting and evaluation cycle, and will become a  crucial element of the accountability and reporting systems of the Organization.  __________________    1 See, for example, A/71/5 (Vol. I), A/69/5 (Vol. I) and JIU/REP/2017/6.  A/72/773      18-03255  16/42    54. For results-based management to be successful, it will be important to change  the behaviours and culture within the Organization so that managers and staff alike  understand the value of proactively managing to achieve results. In order to  strengthen the Secretariat's efforts with regard to results-based management, the  Secretary-General is proposing the establishment of a dedicated function within the  proposed new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to  support those efforts and embed the concept of results-based management as being  ""business as usual"". If approved by the General Assembly, the proposed Department  will guide, support and monitor the effective implementation of results-based  management across the Organization, working with individual departments, offices  and missions and the proposed Office of Finance and Budget in the preparation of  their programme budget documents to support the articulation of a strong and ongoing  focus on results. The annual performance compacts for senior managers will also  reflect the objectives and expected results of the Organization, which will then  cascade down through the workplans of successive levels of managers and staff at all  levels. Those workplans will become the fundamental building block for holding  senior managers and staff at all levels accountable for their performance. The  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support will continue to  provide support to the various entities within the Secretariat until their  reconfiguration into the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  and the Department of Operational Support is completed in January 2019, following  a final decision by the Assembly on the proposed reorganization of the Department  of Management and the Department of Field Support and the creation of the two new  departments, as proposed in the report of the Secretary-General (see A/72/492,  para. 79).   55. As the Board of Auditors has repeatedly emphasized, results-based management  also requires a strong link between programme and financial performance. The  implementation of Umoja Extension 2, starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, will  enable a better understanding and tracking of the links between as well as the costs  of various activities, outputs and results, and the overall costs of the Organization's  programmes, which is necessary to determine if the Organization is using its resources  efficiently.   56. To proactively manage for results, managers need real-time programmatic and  financial  information. The  Organization  will  develop  programme-specific  performance management dashboards that will provide real-time information on  resource utilization and programme implementation. It will ensure greater  transparency and awareness of the extent to which programmes are achieving the  results expected of them and if they are using their resources effectively. The  dashboards, which obtain their information from Umoja and other enterprise systems,  will enhance transparency within the Secretariat and for Member States and lead to a  more effective use of resources.   57. In addition to regularly monitoring the information provided through the  dashboards, managers must periodically evaluate their programmes for a more  in-depth understanding of what is working, what is not working and why, and whether  the programmes are having the intended impact. They must use the findings and  lessons learned from those self-evaluations, and from audits and independent  evaluations, to take timely corrective actions and improve performance. The  Secretary-General is therefore proposing the establishment of a self-evaluation  support function within the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance to provide guidance, support and tools to managers across the Secretariat.  58. The Organization intends to strengthen its monitoring of programmatic results  and will also rely on the independent assessments conducted by the Inspection and    A/72/773    17/42  18-03255    Evaluation Division of OIOS, the Joint Inspection Unit and others. Those new  processes and their interaction are illustrated in figure II above.  59. As stated above, the reforms in that area will build on the conceptual framework  for results-based management, on previous efforts made by the Secretariat in that field  and on lessons learned from other United Nations entities and non-United Nations  entities in the area of results-based management. Important lessons that have been  learned include the need to foster senior-level leadership in results-based  management; to build results frameworks with ownership at all levels; to use results  information for learning, managing, reporting and accountability; to promote and  support a culture of results; and to build an adaptive results-based management  regime through regular reviews and updates.  60. Reflecting the commitment of the Secretary-General to place performance and  the achievement of results at the centre of the Secretariat's accountability system, and  in compliance with resolution 71/283, in which the General Assembly requested the  Secretary-General to propose a detailed plan for the implementation of results-based  management, the Secretary-General is proposing an action plan (see annex II).         IV. ""Three lines of defence"": making the model work within the  context of the United Nations Secretariat      61. The United Nations faces a considerable level and variety of risk owing to the  complexities of its operations and the increased scope of its mandates. The unique  risk profile of the Secretariat ranges, for example, from risks stemming from working  with implementing partners in high-risk environments to the safety and security of  staff members in areas of conflict.   62. In response, the Organization has defined various risk management and control  functions at different levels. The challenge lies in the effective coordination of those  roles to ensure there is no duplication of functions or gaps in the control systems. In  the absence of a cohesive approach, risks might not be promptly identified or  effectively managed.  63. The ""three lines of defence"" model, defined by the Institute of Internal Auditors2  and subsequently adopted by CEB, who specifically tailored it to United Nations  system organizations, provides a simple and effective perspective that clarifies  essential responsibilities and clearly communicates the roles played by different  actors in providing assurance with regard to internal controls.   64. According to the model, the first line of defence includes the functions that own  and manage risks and are responsible for implementing corrective actions to address  process and control deficiencies (i.e., operational managers). The second line of  defence comprises central management functions that oversee risk and internal  controls and provide support and guidance in those areas. The third line of defence  includes the functions that provide independent assurances, such as those conducted  by OIOS.  65. As part of efforts to strengthen the accountability framework, the Secretary- General will strengthen the risk management and control system by reflecting the  three lines of defence model in those processes, as depicted in figure III below.       __________________    2 Institute of Internal Auditors, ""The three lines of defense in effective risk management and  control"" (2013). Available from https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/recommended- guidance/Pages/The-Three-Lines-of-Defense-in-Effective-Risk-Management-and-Control.aspx.  A/72/773      18-03255  18/42        Figure III      Three lines of defence model        66. Applying the model to the United Nations Secretariat, management control and  internal control measures at the operational level constitute the first line of defence.  Operational management is responsible for maintaining effective internal controls  and for executing risk and control procedures on a daily basis. The second line of  defence will be primarily the proposed new Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance, which will be responsible for developing appropriate risk  management policies and tools and, together with the proposed new Department of  Operational Support, will support and monitor the use of delegated authority. The  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will also be responsible  for monitoring performance and for supporting departments, offices, regional  commissions and missions with the reporting of their programme performance. The  United Nations ethical standards, values and principles, including the Ethics Office,    A/72/773    19/42  18-03255    will also be in the second line of defence, as will those functions related to ensuring  the safety and security of the Organization's resources, including both human and  physical resources as well as data. The third line of defence is OIOS, which provides  independent assurance regarding the effectiveness of risk management and internal  controls, including the manner in which the first and second lines of defence achieve  their objectives. The scope of the assurance is reported to senior management and the  General Assembly. The Board of Auditors, as the independent auditors of the  Organization, as well as the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent Audit Advisory  Committee, play important roles in the control structure. While they reside outside  the Organization's structure, they provide independent, external assurances to the  Assembly.         A. First line of defence: the functions that own and manage risk       67. Given the nature of its activities, the risk profile of the Organization is unique.  Risks relevant to the activities of the Secretariat could include those of a strategic or  governance nature, such as the ability to respond and adapt to the needs of changing  environments, or related to specific operational issues, such as the proper planning of  field activities, or to Organization's preparedness to respond to cyberattacks. The  prudent management of the wide range of risks to which the Organization is exposed  on a daily basis is essential to the effective achievement of mandates and is the  responsibility of every manager.   68. Managers will be responsible for implementing regular risk assessments in their  respective departments, offices and missions, for owning and managing the risks  associated with their operations and, accordingly, for establishing and maintaining  effective internal control systems and for ensuring that the activities implemented by  the Organization are aimed at achieving its goals and objectives. They will also be  responsible for the timely implementation of any corrective actions that are required  to address any process and control deficiencies.2 The Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will design procedures that serve as both guidance  and controls in the context of the Secretariat's internal control system. Senior  managers who have delegated authority will be accountable directly to the Secretary- General for ensuring the implementation of and compliance with those procedures by  their staff. It should be clear, however, that despite this ""cascading"" structure, the  accountability will remain with the senior official who received the delegated  authority in the first instance from the Secretary-General, who himself remains  ultimately accountable to Member States for the effective use of resources and the  implementation of mandates.   69. Efforts to increase monitoring and accountability will be assisted by Umoja,  which is providing the Secretariat with greater visibility with regard to transactions  and data and the ability to conduct complex and real-time analyses of critical data.  Robust data visualization and reporting allows for the remote analysis of metrics and  key performance indicators and the production of reports with real-time information,  which in turn allows for the timely detection of inconsistencies and deviations from  established standards and procedures.   70.  In terms of accountability, the Secretariat, through the proposed Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, will support the measures set out below.        Implementation of enterprise risk management by departments, offices  and missions    71.  Enterprise risk management is the inherent core responsibility of management.  Under the three lines of defence model, embedded risk and internal control  A/72/773      18-03255  20/42    management activities are an integral part of the management processes and operations  of the entire Organization. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will be responsible for developing and maintaining the policy framework  and the methodology and tools for enterprise risk management in the Secretariat and  for the provision of technical advice and support to senior managers for the  implementation of risk assessments in their respective departments, offices and  missions (see A/70/5 (Vol. I), para. 122). The Department will support the  dissemination of guidance and best practices concerning risk and internal control  management principles and develop the appropriate communications and training  programmes to enhance the Secretariat's risk management culture. The Department  will also implement Secretariat-wide risk assessments and risk assessments at the  functional level (e.g., procurement), as well as anti-fraud and anti-corruption exercises,  to provide departments, offices and missions with information on the major entity-wide  risks affecting the functioning of the Organization and the actions that can be put into  effect at the enterprise level to mitigate those risks. It is essential that risk management  become part of the Organization's ""DNA"" and that managers undertake risk  assessments on an ongoing basis as part of their day-to-day core functions. It will be  the Department's responsibility to take that forward and bring it to fruition.   72. It is the responsibility of managers at all levels to conduct risk assessment  exercises in their respective areas and, through those risk assessments, identify and  manage the specific risks that might affect them.   73. On the basis of information provided by the departments, offices and missions,  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will prepare a  consolidated entity-level risk register for the Secretariat and update the status of  implementation of the actions taken to mitigate risks by the departments, offices and  missions for distribution to the Management Committee, the Secretary-General  and on behalf of the Secretary-General to the Independent Audit Advisory Committee  and the General Assembly, as may be required.        Delegation of authority matrix    74. A delegation of authority matrix will be designed in line with the delegations of  authority received by the various functional areas of the Organization (e.g., human  resources management, budgeting and finance and procurement). The matrix will  include, among other things, the following elements:    * Responsible official: the head of the department, office or mission that receives  the delegation and who is responsible and accountable for the proper utilization  of the authority delegated    * Authority: the scope of the authority delegated to the senior official to achieve  the objectives of the Organization, including any specific thresholds, limitations  or requirements to subdelegate to certain specialized functional positions    * Monitoring and reporting: the specific monitoring and reporting obligations that  must be fulfilled with the authority delegated, including with regard to the  exercise of any exceptional authority    * Responsibility and accountability: any specific qualifications and/or training  requirements needed to exercise the delegation of authority responsibly, and the  set of regulations, rules, policies and procedures that must be followed or taken  into consideration when exercising the delegated authority  75. The framework will be accompanied by information concerning specific  corrective actions to be taken in cases where: (a) managers intentionally and without  justification violate the terms of the delegation granted to them; (b) managers are  found to be unable to effectively exercise the delegation they have been granted;    A/72/773    21/42  18-03255    and (c) managers do not have the capacity and/or are unable to develop or resource  the capacity to enable them to effectively exercise the delegation they have been  granted. In the event a delegation of authority is withdrawn from the head of a  department, office or mission, such authority will in most instances be transferred to  the Department of Operational Support to exercise on behalf of the entity in question.         Strengthening the senior managers' compacts    76. The senior managers' compacts were strengthened in 2018 to include, among  other things, the profile of leadership of the CEB-endorsed United Nations system  leadership framework; a request to identify a department or mission's top three risks  and plans for their mitigation; protections for whistle-blowers; and the prevention of  and response to allegations of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment. The  compacts will be further revamped in 2019 and will reflect the following new  features:     * The results of the performance dashboards. Programme managers will be  responsible for conducting self-evaluations and incorporating lessons learned  from programme implementation. Programme performance information will be  reported in part II of the proposed integrated annual programme budget, starting  with the 2020 budget period. Peacekeeping-related performance will be reported  in the peacekeeping budget documents. In addition, individual departments,  offices, regional commissions and field missions will develop their own  dashboards detailing the results of their programme implementation. The results  will be an essential element in assessing the results achieved by senior managers  in the performance of their functions.    * The 360-degree evaluation for senior managers. Starting in 2018, all senior  managers will be subject to a 360-degree evaluation of how they have performed  with respect to the nine leadership characteristics that have been determined by  CEB and the Secretary-General to be essential to fulfilling the Organization's  core mandates (see A/72/492, paras. 17 and 18). Those evaluations were already  conducted in 2017 for the heads of peacekeeping missions and for some other  senior leaders. The results of the evaluations will be reflected in the senior  managers' performance assessment.     * The monitoring of staff perceptions of their leadership and managers. Senior  managers play a critical role in shaping the culture of the Organization and, in  particular, in promoting the ethical standards and values enshrined in the Charter  and in the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. Through the Office  of Human Resources Management, the Secretariat will conduct periodic staff  surveys to monitor staff perceptions of leadership and managers (see A/72/492,  para. 18). The results of the surveys will be reflected in the senior managers'  performance assessment. A baseline staff engagement survey was conducted in  2017. The Office is providing support to Secretariat entities with regard to  accessing and understanding their survey results and developing action plans,  which are due to the Office by the end of June 2018. To ensure that targeted  action is taken in all entities, the Office will continue to offer advice and support  on how to interpret and communicate the results and how to maintain  momentum regarding the entity-specific action plans. Additional support will  be made available to heads of entities in the form of executive coaching,  whereby an expert coach will provide one-on-one guidance with regard to  leading the action planning process to ensure that the results are taken seriously  and translated into concrete action and tangible change. The Office will provide  the Management Committee with an update on progress in July 2018, and  provide subsequent updates every six months. The implementation of the action  A/72/773      18-03255  22/42    plans will continue through 2018 and 2019, and a follow-up staff engagement  survey is planned for the end of 2019.        Statement of internal control    77. At the end of each calendar year, every head of a department, office or mission  will be required to sign a statement of internal control attesting to compliance with  the internal control framework under his or her area of responsibility.         B. Second line of defence: the functions that oversee risks and ensure  compliance -- management control       78. The second line of defence under the three lines of defence model relates to the  ""enablers"": the advice and support necessary for operational managers to integrate  risk management into key processes. The provision of advice and support assists  managers in the first line of defence with discharging their responsibilities  successfully and ensuring that risk management is an integral part of all the processes  that take place at their level. Furthermore, the second line of defence is responsible  for the compliance functions, which involve assessing the conformity of the  Organization's operations with the internal control systems, policies, standards,  internal procedures and best practices applicable to its business processes. Under the  proposed new management paradigm, those responsibilities will be entrusted  primarily to the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   79. The compliance functions envisaged in the second line of defence will include  the following:     * Management reviews. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will conduct periodic reviews and assessments regarding whether  the management systems and internal controls in the departments, offices and  missions are performing as intended and producing the desired results as  efficiently as possible in compliance with the relevant regulations, rules and  policies. They will be ongoing ""due diligence"" reviews by management aimed  at filling the gap between the day-to-day work activities in the first line of  defence and the periodic interventions of OIOS, which constitute the third line  of defence. The reviews may include tests of compliance with relevant  regulations, rules and policies at either the policy level (e.g., compliance with  Financial Regulations and Rules and Staff Regulations and Rules) and/or at the  organizational level (e.g., in a peacekeeping mission or regional commission).  The exercises may be conducted remotely by leveraging Umoja and other  information technology tools available within the Organization or, where  necessary, through on-site visits.     * Quality assurance. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance, in collaboration with the Department of Operational Support, will  identify areas that require quality assurance tests to assess whether the  administrative services provided, and the processes followed for their provision,  meet the predetermined quality standards of the various functional areas  (e.g., human resources management, budgeting and finance and supply chain  management) and whether they have been provided in compliance with existing  regulations, rules and policies. That function will prepare quality assurance  reports which will identify, inter alia, strengths and weakness in the processes  followed and services provided, along with remedial actions and/or  recommendations for improvement.     A/72/773    23/42  18-03255      * Evaluation. Evaluation and feedback are critical to good management practices,  as they are required to assess the impact of programme implementation in order  to determine the nature and the cause of any shortfalls and necessary corrective  actions. In addition, when planning for future programme cycles, evaluation  findings and lessons learned are invaluable for programme managers, who will  be responsible for ensuring that the results of evaluation exercises are taken into  account in the preparation of budgets for future cycles. As noted by the Board  of Auditors, a results-based approach to management requires a strong culture  of self-evaluation by programme managers, but most Secretariat departments,  offices and missions do not have any internal capability or capacity to evaluate  the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations (see A/69/5 (Vol. I),  para. 30). The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will  support programme managers by providing related methodological support and  skills development to staff Secretariat-wide, helping to draft terms of reference  for self-evaluations and managing and/or providing quality assurance for self- evaluation activities for departments and offices that might require assistance.  A roster of professional evaluators who can be engaged to conduct evaluations  on behalf of departments that lack in-house expertise will be developed and  maintained by the Department.     * Management assessments. Management assessments consist of a review by the  Management Evaluation Unit of contested managerial decisions to ensure that  those decisions are taken in accordance with the regulations, rules and  applicable administrative issuances (and that those regulations, rules and  issuances are used to amend those decisions when necessary); and to identify  emerging trends and systemic problems so that management can take swift  corrective action. The current management assessment system will be enhanced,  as its findings and recommendations will be linked to those derived from the  monitoring of the delegation of authority.         Guidelines and support with regard to delegation of authority     80. The requirements for the implementation of each delegation will be established  by the Secretary-General upon review and recommendation by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the  Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. The Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will work with the Department of Operational  Support to help managers who have delegated authority understand what is expected  from them and the parameters of the authority granted to them. The Department of  Operational Support will assist managers in building and improving capacities needed  to exercise delegated authority in an accountable manner. In circumstances where  capacity gaps exist, the Department of Operational Support will exercise the  delegated authorities and, where appropriate, work with the senior manager  concerned until such time as the required capacity has been developed to the  satisfaction of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. In  addition, the proposed Management Client Board, a body to be co-chaired by the  heads of the two new departments and which will include rotating representatives of  each of the different types of client entities across the Secretariat (such as departments  and offices at Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions,  peace operations and the field-based offices of special advisers and envoys), will  serve as a mechanism by which the various types of entities can ensure that the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of  Operational Support are aware of their particular requirements and concerns,  therefore improving the ability of the two departments to develop policies and  procedures that can best support the Secretariat in achieving the purposes of the  Organization and delivering on the mandates established by Member States.   A/72/773      18-03255  24/42        Managing delegation of authority     81. As recommended by the Board of Auditors (see A/70/5 (Vol. I), para. 84), the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will produce a  consolidated policy document that clearly sets out delegations of authority, and will  assist business owners and senior managers in the development of policies and  procedures that will govern all delegations of authority, taking into consideration the  Organization's mandates, objectives and structure. That will include ensuring that  each delegated action is appropriately documented, in addition to monitoring and  providing oversight of the use of the authority delegated, including through enterprise  resource systems (e.g., Umoja) and through mobile compliance teams. The  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in collaboration with  the Department of Operational Support, will also define the criteria for corrective  action with respect to improper use of the delegated authority (including the  withdrawal or limitation of the authority and sanctions where appropriate). The  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will be responsible for  monitoring and evaluating compliance with the delegation of authority framework,  including whether circumstances arise that justify the curtailment of any delegation,  in whole or in part. In such a case, upon the recommendation of the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, the Secretary-General will  take remedial action, including by limiting, redirecting or withdrawing the authority  in question. The Department of Operational Support will then work with the entity in  question to enhance its capability until such time as the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance is confident that the entity can responsibly exercise  the delegated authority.         Monitoring segregation of duties     82. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will  coordinate with the relevant offices to identify the systems of segregation of duties  that must exist in the various functional areas of the Organization to ensure  appropriate levels of internal control. It will document those systems of segregation  of duties, communicate that information throughout the Organization and define  procedures for monitoring and providing oversight to the systems. In addition, the  Department will prepare and implement an internal monitoring schedule of the  systems of segregation of duties and conduct periodic reviews of all the levels of  segregation in the Secretariat to ensure that they comply with the control frameworks  and are revised where necessary.         Monitoring performance and compliance through data analytics     83. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will process  and analyse information generated by Umoja and other systems on the functioning of  the Secretariat to uncover systemic problems, hidden patterns, unknown correlations,  trends and other information that can assist the Secretariat in improving the efficiency  and efficacy of its operations and its ability to make more informed and better  business decisions. The information will be provided to managers to improve their  interventions.         Oversight coordination function     84. Programme managers will interact directly with the oversight bodies and be  responsible for implementing oversight body recommendations applicable to their  respective programmes and areas of work. The Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance will review the findings and recommendations of the  oversight bodies (the Board of Auditors, OIOS and the Joint Inspection Unit) to    A/72/773    25/42  18-03255    identify material weaknesses, reportable conditions, systemic issues and best  practices from other entities, and will produce recommendations to remedy or  incorporate them. It will also monitor and report the status of the implementation of  the recommendations to the Management Committee and the General Assembly and  prepare a coordinated management response to the reports and recommendations of  the oversight bodies. In addition, the Department will develop and circulate  guidelines to the Secretariat departments, offices and missions regarding ways to  effectively engage with the oversight bodies. The Department will also act as the  Secretariat's focal point for the Joint Inspection Unit.   85. A key role under the second line of defence structure is the one played by the  Ethics Office of the United Nations. In the performance of its functions, the Office  offers five lines of service: confidential ethics advice; ethics awareness-raising and  education; reviews of requests for protection against retaliation for reporting  misconduct; the financial disclosure programme; and the promotion of coherence and  common ethics standards across the United Nations system. The Ethics Office assists  the Secretary-General in ensuring that all staff members perform their functions  towards achieving the objectives and results of the Organization in a manner that is  consistent with the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter and the  relevant staff regulations and rules that define the United Nations staff standards of  conduct.         C. Third line of defence: the functions that provide independent  assurance -- role of the Office of Internal Oversight Services       86. OIOS constitutes the third line of defence in the Secretariat. It is the internal  and operationally independent oversight body of the Secretariat. It assists the  Secretary-General in protecting the Organization's assets by providing assurance that  programme activities have led to the programmed results and have been implemented  in compliance with all relevant resolutions, regulations, rules and policies of the  Organization. It also plays a key role in preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse,  malfeasance and mismanagement. OIOS conducts audits, evaluations, inspections  and investigations and its reports are presented directly to the General Assembly.   87. The second and third lines of defence must work in close cooperation to avoid  duplication and overlap, and to inform each other, and the governing bodies, of the  results of their work. Those efforts will increase the effectiveness of their  interventions and transparency with regard to the functioning of the Organization.         Oversight bodies external to the United Nations Secretariat that have an  independent assurance role     88. The Board of Auditors is an independent and system-wide oversight body that  performs external audits of the accounts of the United Nations and its funds and  programmes and reports its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly  through the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The  core responsibility of the Board relates to financial and compliance auditing and the  certification of the financial statements. The Board also conducts financial,  managerial and performance audits and special assignments at the request of the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.   89. The Joint Inspection Unit is an external and system-wide oversight body of the  United Nations system, responsible to the General Assembly and to the competent  legislative organs of those specialized agencies and other international organizations  within the United Nations system that have accepted its statute. It conducts  evaluations, inspections and investigations.   A/72/773      18-03255  26/42    90. The Independent Audit Advisory Committee serves in an expert advisory  capacity to the General Assembly, assisting the Assembly in fulfilling its oversight  responsibilities. The Committee is responsible for advising the Assembly on the  scope, results and effectiveness of audit and other oversight functions, especially  those of OIOS; measures to ensure management's compliance with audit and other  oversight recommendations; and various risk management, internal control,  operational, accounting and disclosure issues. In addition, the Committee advises the  Assembly on measures to increase and facilitate cooperation among United Nations  oversight bodies.         V. Conclusion       91. The Secretary-General's reform proposals will empower managers and staff at  large to focus their efforts fully on the delivery of results and engage in a process of  continuous learning and improvement. The measures to strengthen the Secretariat's  accountability system described in the present report will ensure that managers and  staff receive the support, guidance and training to conduct their work and themselves  in an informed and accountable manner and that their performance is monitored  regularly and reported accurately, and that corrective actions and disciplinary  measures are taken when required.         VI. Recommendation to the General Assembly       92. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the progress made and  the plans to further strengthen the Secretariat's accountability system, as  described in the present report.        A/72/773    27/42  18-03255    Annex I        Accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat         I.  Introduction     1.  In its resolution 64/259, the General Assembly defined the term ""accountability""  for the Secretariat. In 2010, the Secretary-General presented to the Assembly a  framework for the accountability system of the Secretariat, consisting of six main  interrelated components.   2.  Since 2010, the accountability system and the internal control framework have  been further strengthened to reflect the evolving objectives, standards and processes  of the United Nations. At the request of Member States, annual progress reports on  accountability have been presented to the General Assembly since 2010.   3.  Pursuant to the Secretary-General's management reform proposals included in  his report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492 and A/72/492/Add.1), the present annex  presents an enhanced and integrated version of the United Nations accountability  system in line with the new management paradigm proposed by the Secretary-General  and reflecting the changes to the Organization's administrative structures and  functions over time.   4.  The Secretariat's accountability system establishes the expectations for sound  and efficient management practices and performance. It provides information to all  staff members about the Organization's principles, structures, policies and processes  to enable them to discharge their responsibilities in an accountable manner. It is an  important document that staff at all levels -- as well as all stakeholders -- should  know and understand.   5.  On the basis of the updated version of the system contained in the present annex,  the Secretariat will issue global management accountability guidance that further  clarifies, in simple and understandable language, what the accountability system of  the Secretariat is, what its components are and how all of the components fit together  to build a better-managed and more efficient Organization.       II.  Five guiding principles     6.  The present updated version of the Secretariat's accountability system has been  prepared using five main guiding principles:     * Integrity: All staff members are expected to perform their functions with a keen  sense of duty and purpose to uphold the values of the United Nations and to act  with honesty and with the best interests of the Organization in mind.     * Transparency: Refers to a process by which reliable, timely information about  existing conditions, decisions and actions relating to the activities of the  Organization is made accessible, visible and understandable to all stakeholders. 1     * Decentralization: Implies the systematic delegation of authority at all levels of  management and throughout the Organization, bringing decision-making closer  to the point of delivery and trusting and empowering managers while ensuring  greater accountability and transparency.   __________________    1 Mervyn King, Mario Draghi and others, ""Report of the Working Group on Transparency and  Accountability"" (October 1998). Available from www.imf.org/external/np/g22/index.htm#trans.   A/72/773      18-03255  28/42      * Simplicity: The policy framework that governs the functioning of the  Organization must be fit for purpose, lean and easy to understand, interpret and  apply.     * Diversity: The United Nations is a global organization that should be staffed  with a culturally and geographically diverse, gender-balanced, international and  multitalented workforce that is truly representative of, and benefits, all the  peoples we serve. The workforce should have easy access to the knowledge and  means that allow it to discharge its responsibilities in an effective and  accountable manner.       III.  Definition of accountability and its components     7.  In its resolution 64/259, the General Assembly approved the following  definition of accountability for the United Nations:     Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be  answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception.     Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a timely  and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all mandates  to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies and  other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and  resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of  rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important role of the  oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted recommendations.   8.  The Secretariat's accountability system has six main components: (a) the  Charter of the United Nations; (b) the programme, planning and budget documents;  (c) results and performance; (d) internal systems and controls; (e) ethical standards  and integrity; and (f) the oversight roles and functions. Those components are  interrelated and interact as shown in figure I below and as explained underneath.           A/72/773    29/42  18-03255    Figure I  Accountability system of the United Nations Secretariat       * External oversight bodies that provide independent assurance to the General Assembly.     The Charter is the foundational document of the United Nations and enshrines its basic principles, purposes and organs. Membe r  States issue mandates, expressed as directives, priorities and targets, and the Secretary-General is responsible for implementing  those mandates and for reporting on outcomes and the resources used. In discharging his responsibilities, the Secretary-General is  obliged to reflect those mandates in the programme budget and the peacekeeping budgets. Programme managers and individual  staff members are obliged to prepare their respective workplans with the purpose of achieving the results established therein.  During that process, the Secretariat must continuously monitor performance, adjust implementation where needed, conduct  ongoing evaluations and use evaluation findings for improvement and learning.       A/72/773      18-03255  30/42        Description of the components     9.  The Charter of the United Nations enshrines the basic principles of the  Organization and identifies its principal organs and their roles and responsibilities as  well as those of the Secretary-General. The Charter, among other things, establishes  that the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations  (Article 97) and entrusts him with implementing the mandates promulgated by the  principal organs of the United Nations (Article 98).   10. The programme planning and budget documents reflect the mandates of  Member States and represent the commitment of the Secretariat to implement those  mandates and to use approved resources responsibly. Those documents include:     * The programme budget     * The peacekeeping budgets     * The support account budget     * The budgets of the International Tribunals   11.  Member States also provide voluntary contributions to the Secretariat, which  are presented as extrabudgetary funds in the context of programme budgets. Those  resources come with a programme support charge to cover the costs related to the  Secretariat's support, and guidance related to the activities financed with the  resources.   12. Results and performance refers to the obligation of the Organization to deliver  on the outcomes and outputs reflected in the results framework of the programme  planning and budget documents and to report accurately on those results to Member  States. Every senior manager and staff member is expected to reflect their individual  contributions towards achieving those results in their respective workplans and to  have their performance assessed on the basis of the effectiveness of their contributions  towards that end. Performance is assessed and, in the case of the Organization as a  whole and of individual senior managers, also reported through the following  mechanisms:     * Organizational performance. The Secretariat is obliged to present in the  budget documents the results that were achieved by the Organization in the last  completed budget cycle. That information should include: the outcomes to  which the department or office contributed during the budget cycle and the  outputs that were implemented, the results of the evaluations and self- evaluations carried out during the period and the lessons learned. How that  information is presented to Member States, and how often, depends on which  type of budget provided the resources for the activities.     * Senior managers' compacts. The annual workplans agreed by the senior-most  officials of the Organization and the Secretary-General regarding the results  they are individually expected to achieve, including the results established in  the planning and budget documents, as well as a set of compliance,  accountability and managerial objectives that reflect the priorities of the  Member States and the Secretary-General. The compacts serve as the basis for  assessing their performance.     * Performance appraisal system. The annual commitment every staff member  makes with their supervisor to contribute to the Organization's overall results,  and the assessment of their performance against that commitment.     * Rewards, remedial actions and sanctions. Currently, with the possible  exception of the within-grade increment, no rewards are available for the    A/72/773    31/42  18-03255    recognition of high-performing staff from an individual performance  management perspective. Remedial actions and sanctions can be applied either  in cases of underperformance or deviations from the principles and values that  govern staff conduct and behaviour, which are contained in the Charter, the  standards of conduct for the international civil service (see ST/SGB/2016/9) and  the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. Remedial measures may  include counselling, transfer to more suitable functions, additional training  and/or the institution of a time-bound performance improvement plan. Sanctions  may include the withholding of a within-grade salary increment, the  non-renewal of an appointment, demotion or the termination of an appointment.   13. The internal control system is the policy framework that exists in the  Organization to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of its  objectives with adequate resource utilization and reliable reporting. The system also  includes the mechanisms and processes that exist to protect staff members from any  excess in the performance of their work. Those systems may be grouped into three  main categories: the regulations, rules and policies; critical organizational systems;  and the compliance mechanism, as set out below:     * The regulations, rules and policies. The hierarchy of norms that govern the  fundamental conditions of service and the basic rights, duties and obligations of  the United Nations Secretariat as well as all the issues related to the  administration of the United Nations. They include: the Staff Regulations and  Rules; the Financial Regulations and Rules; and the Regulations and Rules  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation. Further down in  the hierarchy, the Secretariat has administrative issuances, manuals and  guidelines (e.g., on human resources, finance, procurement and peacekeeping)  and standard operating procedures governing various aspects of its work.     * Organizational systems. Important processes and structures that ensure the  effective functioning of the Organization, the proper stewardship of resources  and the achievement of objectives of the Organization. The systems include:     * Systems for selecting and contracting United Nations personnel,  consultants and contractors. The Secretariat's staff selection system,  which is clearly defined in administrative instructions. The system  integrates the recruitment, placement, promotion and mobility processes  within the Organization. It is complemented by the role of the central  review bodies, which, as a component of the Secretariat's system of  segregation of duties, ensures that all candidates have been evaluated on  the basis of approved evaluation criteria and that the applicable procedures  have been followed during the process.     * Enterprise risk management. The processes and structures the Secretariat  has in place to identify potential events that may affect the normal  functioning of the Secretariat and the achievement of its objectives and  goals, and to manage those risks to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the achievement of those objectives. The main elements include: the  Secretariat's enterprise risk management policy framework and  methodology; the Secretariat-wide risk assessment and the anti-fraud and  anti-corruption risk assessments; the provision of technical support to  senior managers for the implementation of enterprise risk management in  their respective departments, offices and missions; and the responsibility  of every senior manager to conduct risk assessment exercises in their  respective departments, offices and missions to identify, evaluate and  A/72/773      18-03255  32/42    manage the specific risks that might affect them while managing their  operations.     * Segregation of duties. The system of internal controls embedded in the  Secretariat's functioning by which no single individual has control over  all phases of a decision or transaction that involves the resources of the  Organization. The separation reduces the possibility that a single  individual can breach the regulations, rules or procedures or cause  financial loss to the Organization.     * Delegation of authority. The cascading of authority, including decision- making authority, from the Secretary-General downward, entrusting  officials with the authority to take the required decisions for the  achievement of the Organizational objectives and goals, while holding  them accountable for their decisions and the related consequences.     * Conduct and discipline. The structure and mechanisms that provide overall  direction on prevention and compliance for conduct and discipline issues,  and ensures that appropriate action is taken in all cases of failure to comply  with the standards of conduct of the United Nations.     * Systems that ensure fairness in the workplace. The set of structures and  mechanisms that the Organization has in place to ensure that the staff are  treated fairly and that decisions taken by the Organization are honest, fair  and unbiased. The systems include the Ombudsman and the informal and  formal systems of justice.     * Compliance mechanism. The obligation of the Secretariat to continuously  monitor and analyse its performance and its management processes to improve  the efficiency and quality of the services provided, and to ensure that managerial  decisions are taken in full compliance with the regulations, rules and policies of  the Organization. The mechanisms include:     * Statement of internal control. At the end of each calendar year, every head  of department, office and mission will be required to sign a statement of  internal control attesting that the internal controls under his or her area of  responsibility have functioned adequately.     * Management reviews. Periodic assessments carried out by the central  management function to ensure that management systems and internal  controls are performing as intended and producing the desired results as  efficiently as possible and in compliance with relevant regulations, rules  and policies.     * Management assessments. Evaluation of managerial decisions to ensure  that they have been taken in accordance with the regulations, rules and  administrative issuances and to identify emerging trends and systemic  problems so that management can take swift corrective actions.     * Quality assurance. Continuous assurance tests to assess whether the  administrative services provided, and the processes followed for their  provision, meet the quality standards predetermined by the process owners  and follow existing regulations, rules and policies.     * Reports on Organizational performance and programme performance  dashboards. Reports that inform all stakeholders of the results of  programme implementation, which include both quantitative information  and the analysis of outputs implemented, the progress made towards the  targets and qualitative statements on the results achieved. The reports also  include the results of the evaluations implemented during the previous    A/72/773    33/42  18-03255    completed budget cycle and the lessons learned. A summary of each report  will be included in the programme performance dashboards accessible to  all stakeholders through the Internet.     * Evaluations. Assessments of the impact of programme implementation to  determine its achievements and, if required, the nature and cause of the  shortfalls and ways to correct them.     * Guidelines and support on delegation of authority. The provision of  guidance and support to managers to whom authority has been delegated  to ensure they understand what is expected from them and the parameters  of that authority.     * Managing delegation of authority. A set of actions aimed at ensuring that  each instance of delegated authority has been appropriately documented  and the continuous monitoring of oversight functions to ensure that  delegated authorities are being used appropriately.     * Monitoring segregation of duties. Documentation, monitoring and  oversight of the systems of segregation that must exist in the different  functional areas of the Organization to ensure appropriate levels of internal  controls.     * Data analytics. The continuous processing and analysis of the information  generated by the Organization to uncover systemic problems, hidden  patterns, unknown correlations, trends and other useful information that  can assist in making better-informed business decisions and improve  efficiency.     * Oversight coordination function. The set of actions aimed at reviewing the  findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies to ensure their  effective implementation by management and to identify material  weaknesses, reportable conditions and systemic issues.   14. Ethical standards and integrity refers to the commitment of the Secretary- General and all staff, in particular senior managers, to uphold the highest ethical  standards and integrity, as reflected in the mechanisms, policies, principles and values  that set the standards for the conduct and behaviour of United Nations personnel,  including but not limited to:     * The relevant regulations and rules that define the ethical standards of staff  members (including the oath of office)     * The Ethics Office     * Policies for avoiding conflicts of interest (e.g., outside employment, political  activity, gifts, hospitality and awards)     * The financial disclosure programme     * The Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations     * Protection from retaliation     * Preventing sexual exploitation and abuse   15. The oversight functions independently assess the adequacy and effectiveness  of the internal control systems, the efficient utilization of resources and the  Organization's and staff members' adherence to professional and ethical standards.  They include:   A/72/773      18-03255  34/42      * The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). An internal and  operationally independent oversight body that conducts audits, evaluations,  inspections and investigations.     * External auditors (Board of Auditors). An independent oversight body that  conducts external financial, managerial and performance audits, and undertakes  special assignments at the request of the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions/General Assembly.     * The Joint Inspection Unit. An external and system-wide body. It conducts  evaluations, inspections and investigations.     * The Independent Audit Advisory Committee. A subsidiary body of the  General Assembly whose responsibilities include overseeing the work of OIOS  and advising the Assembly on management risk and internal control and on  financial reporting.       IV.  The three lines of defence: ensuring effective management of resources and  internal controls     16. In the context of the current management reform discussion, the Secretary- General is adding the three lines of defence model to the existing internal control  system (see figure II). The model will clarify essential roles and responsibilities for  risk management and controls within the Organization and improve the effectiveness  of the risk management systems. Under the model, management control and internal  control measures at the operational level are the first line of defence in risk  management. The second line of defence consists of various risk management and  compliance functions to support and monitor the first line of defence. Independent  assurance on the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, including  the manner in which the first and second lines of defence achieve risk management  and control objectives, form the third line of defence. The Board of Auditors, as the  independent auditors of the Organization, as well as the Joint Inspection Unit and the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee, play an important role in the control  structure. While they reside outside the Organization's structure, they provide  independent, external assurances to the General Assembly.   17. As the first line of defence, operational managers will be responsible for  implementing regular risk assessments in their respective departments, offices and  missions, for owning and managing the risks associated with their operations and,  accordingly, for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls systems and  for ensuring that the activities implemented by the Organization are aimed at  achieving its goals and objectives. They will also be responsible for the timely  implementation of any corrective actions that are required to address any process and  control deficiencies.2 The proposed Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will design procedures that serve as both guidance and controls in the  context of the Secretariat's internal control system. Senior managers who have  delegated authority will be accountable directly to the Secretary-General for ensuring  the implementation of and compliance with those procedures by their staff. It should  be clear, however, that despite this ""cascading"" structure, the accountability will  remain with the senior official who received the delegated authority in the first  instance from the Secretary-General, who himself remains ultimately accountable to  Member States for the effective use of resources and the implementation of mandates.   __________________    2 Institute of Internal Auditors, ""The three lines of defense in effective risk management and  control"" (2013).

The second line of defence will be primarily the proposed new Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, which will be responsible for  developing appropriate risk management policies and tools and, together with the  proposed new Department of Operational Support, will support and monitor the use  of delegated authority. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will also be responsible for monitoring performance throughout the  Organization and for supporting departments, offices, regional commissions and  missions with the reporting of their programme performance. The United Nations  ethical standards, values and principles, including the role of the Ethics Office, will  also be in the second line of defence, as will those functions related to ensuring the  safety and security of the Organization's resources, including both human and  physical resources as well as data.   A/72/773      18-03255  36/42    19. The third line of defence is OIOS, which provides independent assurance  regarding the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, including the  manner in which the first and second lines of defence achieve their risk management  and control objectives. The scope of the assurance is reported to senior management  and the General Assembly.      A/72/773    37/42  18-03255    Annex II       Action plan for the implementation of results-based management  in the United Nations Secretariat, 2018-2021        I.  Introduction     1.  In his report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492 and A/72/492/Add.1), the Secretary- General stressed his commitment to strengthening the culture of accountability within  the Secretariat. Measures towards that goal include strengthening the implementation  of results-based management, redirecting the efforts of staff at all levels towards the  achievement of the Organization's objectives and goals and shifting the focus of the  Secretariat's efforts from inputs and activities to results and outcomes. Results will  inform decision-making throughout the entire planning, programme budgeting and  evaluation cycle, and will become an important element of the accountability and  reporting systems of the Organization. The General Assembly, in its resolution  71/283, requested the Secretary-General to propose a detailed plan, with a fixed time  frame and clear milestones, for the implementation of results-based management in  the regular functioning of the Organization.       II.  Action plan     2.  Experience in the successful implementation of results-based management  demonstrates that building a results-oriented culture requires an informed demand for  results information by all stakeholders; supportive organizational systems, incentives,  procedures and practices; a results-oriented accountability regime; capacity to learn  and adapt; results measurement and results-based management capacity; and clear  roles and responsibilities. 1  In addition, the Board of Auditors has noted the  importance of visible leadership from senior management in promoting and  advancing the accountability system as a whole by setting an appropriate ""tone at the  top"" to drive forward the implementation of results-based management and the need  to build a strong culture of self-evaluation by programme managers (see A/69/5  (Vol. I), para. 30) and the importance of using performance measures that reflect the  main expected accomplishments of a department and that are helpful to managers  trying to understand current performance (see A/71/5 (Vol. I), para. 93).   3.  On the basis of that understanding, the Secretary-General has previously  requested the creation of a results-based management capacity to drive the  implementation of this important initiative, but the proposals were not approved at  the time (see A/62/701, A/62/701/Corr.1 and A/62/701/Add.1, and A/64/640).  Therefore, implementing results-based management in the Secretariat has proceeded  in a ""phased manner"" in accordance with resolution 67/253 and the limited resources  available in the Secretariat for that purpose. Progress has been made in formulating  the results frameworks in the planning and budget documents in a more results- oriented manner, but more work is required. The Board of Auditors recommends that  the Administration accelerate its current process of strengthening the performance  measures used by departments to measure and report results (see A/71/5 (Vol. I),  para. 99). To that end, the Secretary-General is proposing the establishment of a  dedicated results-based management function as part of his management reform  proposal.   __________________    1 John Mayne, ""Best practices in results-based management: a review of experience -- a report for  the United Nations Secretariat, volume 1: main report"" (July 2007). Available from  www.focusintl.com/RBM043-2007%2007%20UN%20Best%20Practices%20in%20Results- Based%20Management.pdf.   A/72/773      18-03255  38/42    4.  In addition to what the Secretariat has learned from others' experience in  implementing results-based management (including that of the United Nations  system,2 and the findings and recommendations of a working group representing the  different functional areas of the Organization and chaired by the Department of  Management), and what the Secretariat has learned during the present process, the  Secretary-General proposes the plan set out below, which is based on five main  actions for strengthening the implementation of results-based management in the  Secretariat for the period 2018-2021.         Action 1. Fostering the commitment of senior management to the  implementation of results-based management and accountability     5.  Best practices in implementing results-based management demonstrate that  fostering senior-level leadership is fundamental for its successful implementation.  That is, senior leaders must visibly, regularly and consistently lead and support  results-based management through their words and actions.   6.  To achieve that objective, the activities set out in table 1 are being proposed.        Table 1   Detailed activities for the achievement of action 1     Detailed activity   Responsible entity  Implementation dates        The Secretary-General will send a  communication to senior managers  stressing their obligation to participate in  and support all results-based management  initiatives to be implemented in their  respective departments, offices and  missions  Executive Office of the  Secretary-General  Mid-2018   The Secretary-General will lead a high- level advocacy and outreach campaign to  emphasize to senior managers and staff the  need for the Organization to enhance its  focus on the achievement of clearly  defined results, including through iSeek  stories, posters and pamphlets  Executive Office of the  Secretary-General, Department  of Management (2018),  Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance  and Department of Public  Information (from 2019 onward)  2018-2021  (continuous)  The Secretary-General will incorporate in  the senior managers' compacts a  performance indicator assessing every  senior manager's contribution to the  implementation of results-based  management   Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance, Executive Office  of the Secretary-General  2019 (senior  managers'  performance to be  assessed with this  indicator from  2019 onward)      __________________    2 Angela Bester, ""Results-based management in the United Nations development system: progress  and challenges -- a report prepared for the United Nations Department of Economic and Social  Affairs, for the quadrennial comprehensive policy review"", final report (July 2012).

Strengthening the Secretariat's capacities3 in results planning,  budgeting and reporting     7.  The results-based frameworks are part of results-based management. The results  chains embedded in those frameworks show a chain from inputs to outputs, which  contribute to the collective achievement of the objective through results. The  frameworks should clearly reflect the results and how they contribute to the collective  achievement of the objective. In addition to planning and budgeting, the Secretariat  will focus on improving monitoring, reporting and evaluation in order to demonstrate  the results to which the Organization contributes.   8.  In his report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492 and A/72/492/Add.1), the Secretary- General put forward proposals for the reform of the regular budget process. In its  resolution 72/266, the General Assembly approved the change from a biennial to an  annual budget period on a trial basis and decided that the proposed programme budget  document would consist of three parts: a plan outline, a programme plan and  programme performance information, and post and non-post resource requirements.   9.  To achieve those objectives, the activities set out in table 2 are being proposed.         Table 2   Detailed activities for the achievement of action 2     Detailed activity   Responsible entity  Implementation dates        Following the decision of the General  Assembly, the Secretariat has launched a  comprehensive change management  process through which, during 2018,  capacity will be established in all  departments, offices and special political  missions to prepare their respective  results-based programme plans and  programme performance information. By  integrating programme performance  information into the budget reports, the  Secretariat will enhance evidence-based  planning and accountability for its work  Department of Management  2018-2019  The Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance will design and  implement tailor-made workshops and  coaching sessions for senior managers and  staff at all levels on the implementation of  results-based management and on their  respective roles and responsibilities in the  implementation of results-based  management  Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance  Third quarter 2019- 31 December 2021  (continuous)  __________________    3 Zoe Radnor and David Try, ""Developing an understanding of results-based management through  public value theory"", International Journal of Public Sector Management, vol. 20, No. 7 (2007).  Both authors emphasized the importance of training at all levels with regard to the application of  results-based management as well as the importance of motivating senior managers to embrace  the approach in order to ensure its successful implementation.

Upgrading the Secretariat's information technology platform to  support the results-based management system     10. One of the key factors for the successful implementation of results-based  management is the presence of the required supportive systems. That includes not  only an established function responsible for driving the process, but the information  technology tools that enable practitioners of results-based management to establish a  link among objectives, results, outputs and resources.   11.  With the implementation of Umoja Extension 2, the Secretariat will overcome  that limitation, as the updated system will allow the Secretariat to assess performance  at the programme and subprogramme levels relative to resources and measure the  effect that resource allocation changes may have on programme performance.   12. To achieve that objective, the activity set out in table 3 is being proposed.

Using results information for learning and managing and for  reporting, programming, planning, budgeting and accountability     13. Clear roles and responsibilities should be created among the different actors  responsible for programme implementation for the achievement of the Organization's  objectives and results. That critical linkage will be established through the workplans  contained in the annual performance compacts of senior managers. Responsibility for  achieving the results consistent with the approved goals and objectives of the  Organization will thus cascade down through the workplans of successive levels of    A/72/773    41/42  18-03255    managers and staff. That cascade will also become the fundamental building block  for holding staff at all levels accountable for the achievement of specific results.   14. Another essential element to implement results-based management is the ability  of the Secretariat to conduct self-evaluations and to actively include lessons learned  in the planning and budgeting process of the Organization. Evaluations will critically  examine programme implementation to draw conclusions about its relevance,  effectiveness, efficiency and/or impact. Evaluations will inform programming,  planning and budgeting decisions and allow for the introduction of corrective actions,  if required. The knowledge and understanding gained from the implementation of a  programme, subprogramme or project, including lessons both positive and negative,  are also fundamental when taking relevant decisions.   15.

Section II of the report provides an update on three priority achievements that  are integral to enabling faster, more sustainable progress in strengthening the  accountability system under the new management paradigm: (a) improving the system  of delegation of authority; (b) strengthening the implementation of results-based  management; and (c) establishing the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division.    Section III gives an overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat  against the six components of the accountability system. The progress made in the  current reporting period and key deliverables going forward are outlined.    Although progress has been made, more remains to be done in 2019 to further  strengthen the accountability system in support of the Secretary-General's new  management paradigm. This is to be the primary focus of the new Business  Transformation and Accountability System Division, which will support managers and  staff in improving their understanding of what is expected of them with respect to  governance, policy, risks and internal controls in accordance with the Charter of the  United Nations, the resolutions and decisions of the principal organs of the United  Nations and the regulations and rules. The Division will also help entities to embed  the ""three lines of defence"" model in enterprise risk management processes at all levels  of the Secretariat.      * The present report was submitted late in order to reflect the most recent information.  A/73/688      18-22826  2/30      The new management paradigm is dependent on the Secretariat's ability to  undertake a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. A culture shift of such significance can happen only over  time. When all the measures proposed in the present report are implemented, they will  support tangible progress going forward.            A/73/688    3/30  18-22826      I. Introduction      1.  The Secretary-General has made greater accountability of staff and managers  for the effective use of resources and improved delivery of mandates a cornerstone of  his management reform process. Increased accountability is a critical element for  achieving organizational results. The General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266 B,  stressed that accountability is a central principle of management reform.   2.  In 2010, the Secretary-General proposed to the General Assembly a framework  for the accountability system of the Secretariat, consisting of six main interrelated  components that are embedded in the definition of accountability approved by the  General Assembly in its resolution 64/259. The Secretary-General has since submitted  annual reports to the General Assembly on efforts to strengthen the accountability  system and the internal control framework of the Organization.   3.  The present progress report provides an update on accountability measures.  Following the introduction in section I, section II provides an update on three key  achievements that are integral to enabling faster progress in strengthening the  accountability system under the new management paradigm. Section III gives an  overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat against the six components  of the accountability system. Sections IV and V contain conclusions and  recommendations.   4.  In addition, the status of implementation of the recommendations of oversight  bodies during the period from 2008 to 2017 is outlined in annex I; progress in the  implementation of results-based management is described in annex II; and annex III  contains a summary of progress in the implementation of General Assembly  resolution 72/303.        II. Progress in enhancing accountability under the new  management paradigm       5.  Strengthening the accountability system and the internal control framework of  the Secretariat has been a continuous process. In recent years, for example, the  Secretariat has established an Ethics Office, instituted a financial disclosure  programme, developed senior managers' compacts and begun to embed enterprise risk  management and results-based management in its functioning. Those efforts have  been reflected in the annual progress reports presented to the General Assembly since  2010.  6.  In his report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492), the Secretary-General highlighted the  following six key challenges that need to be addressed if the Organization is to be  more effective and responsive to those it serves:     (a)  Slow and unresponsive service delivery;     (b)  Fragmentation in management structures;     (c)  A weak performance management culture;     (d)  Gaps in resourcing of mandates and ineffective management of resources  for the implementation of mandates;     (e)  Gaps in transparency and accountability;    (f)  A trust deficit between Member States and the Secretariat.  A/73/688      18-22826  4/30    7.  In addition, in the 2017 staff engagement survey, it was found that 30 per cent  of staff members had concerns about ethical conduct and the culture of accountability  in the Organization.  8.  The six challenges noted by the Secretary-General, the perceptions of staff, the  views of the oversight bodies and resolutions of the General Assembly indicate that  there are deficiencies in the implementation of the accountability system and its  practical operation.   9.  Accordingly, the Secretary-General's new management paradigm places  improving accountability at the centre of two commitments. The first is to give senior  managers the full authority to deliver on their mandates, as long as they do so  transparently, responsibly and accountably. The second is a pledge to Member States  that the Secretariat will be transparent, responsible and accountable in its stewardship  of the resources of the Organization and in delivering on agreed mandates.  10. The General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266 B, welcomed the commitment  of the Secretary-General to improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on  its mandates through management reform, and stressed that accountability is a central  principle of management reform. In its resolution 72/303, the Assembly welcomed  the efforts of the Secretary-General towards a strong culture of accountability  throughout the Secretariat, and stressed that an effective accountability system is  central to successful management of the Organization.  11. In his seventh progress report on accountability (A/72/773, para. 41), the  Secretary-General stressed the importance of the implementation of the following  actions for increased accountability in the context of the new management paradigm:    (a)  Updating the Secretariat's accountability system and preparing  management accountability guidance;     (b)  Strengthening the implementation of results-based management;     (c)  Placing a stronger emphasis on the ""three lines of defence"" model to  improve the risk management systems;     (d)  Strengthening the senior managers' compact system;     (e)  Adopting a statement of internal control;     (f)  Creating an improved system of delegation of authority;     (g)  Developing a new set of monitoring and compliance functions.  12. This section provides an update on three key achievements that are integral to  enabling faster, more sustainable progress in strengthening the accountability system  under the new management paradigm: (a) improving the system of delegation of  authority; (b) strengthening the implementation of results-based management; and  (c) establishing the Business Transformation and Accountability Division.   13. Progress in implementing the other new functions and processes of the  Secretariat's accountability system is described in section III.         A. Improving the system of delegation of authority      14. In paragraph 17 of its resolution 72/303, the General Assembly stressed the need  for the Secretary-General to address the deficiencies in the current system of  delegation of authority through the promulgation of well-defined roles and  responsibilities of individuals at all levels to whom authority is delegated, systemic  reporting mechanisms on monitoring and exercise of delegated authority, risk    A/73/688    5/30  18-22826    mitigation and safeguard measures, and actions to be taken in cases of  mismanagement or abuse of authority.        Progress to date     15. As the chief administrative officer, the Secretary-General holds the primary  authority and accountability for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules  and the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. In December 2018,  the Secretary-General issued a bulletin (ST/SGB/2019/2) for the purposes of aligning  authorities with responsibilities, decentralizing decision-making and strengthening  accountability. From 1 January 2019, to bring decision-making closer to the point of  delivery, heads of entities will exercise delegated managerial authority over human,  financial and physical resources under the Staff Regulations and Rules and the  Financial Regulations and Rules. The annexes to the bulletin set out the standard  authorities that a head of entity may receive, depending on the capacity of the entity  to receive and exercise the delegations in a responsible and effective manner. All  delegations of authority are issued and recorded through a dedicated online portal.   16. Heads of entities also received a formal document that stated that any delegation  is granted in relation to their current role and function and that set out their personal  responsibility for duly discharging the authority and accountability for incorrectly  applying or failing to correctly discharge the authority. Authority delegated to a head  of entity may be further delegated, but the head of entity remains accountable and  responsible. Subdelegations should be along reporting lines and on a functional and  not a personal basis and be consistent with responsibilities.  17. Figure I illustrates the delegation of authority, including roles and  responsibilities, based on a standard four-stage cycle for continuous improvement of  plan, do, check and act. Should circumstances arise that justify a curtailment of  delegated authority, delegations may be suspended, amended or revoked by the  Secretary-General on the advice of the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General  for Operational Support. This could result in administrative or disciplinary measures,  as appropriate, in accordance with the Staff Regulations and Rules.      A/73/688      18-22826  6/30    Figure I   Cycle of delegation of decision-making authority            Monitoring delegations of authority    18. The Monitoring and Evaluation Service of the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division will monitor key performance indicators across human  resources, finance, procurement, travel and property management by using  information from Umoja, Inspira and Unite Apps and/or requesting information from  managers and by conducting management reviews. Although it was established only  recently, the framework was designed to help heads of entities to demonstrate that  they are exercising the authorities delegated to them to ""the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity"" (Charter of the United Nations, Article 101.3).  If applied effectively, the framework will:     (a)  Enable heads of entities to demonstrate that they are exercising their  delegated authority in a transparent, responsible and accountable manner by:    (i)  Complying with regulations and rules, the policy framework and internal  controls;    (ii) Effectively managing the delegation cycle;    (iii) Monitoring performance trends over time, sharing lessons on why  performance is improving or triggering an intervention when performance is  deteriorating;    (b)  Enable the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  to monitor how heads of entities are exercising their delegated authorities and to  provide assurance to the Secretary-General by:   * * Purpose: Heads of entities and the  the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance monitor  the exercise of delegated authority,  reporting variations in performance and  non-compliance * Purpose:                                                       To resolve problems in the exercise of  delegated authority in the most effective  way to improve performance and  prevent future non-compliance and to  ensure that lessons learned are fed back  into step A, ""Plan"" * Purpose:                                                    Heads of entities exercise their  delegations of authority effectively and in  compliance with the regulatory     framework * Purpose:                                                                To ensure that the accountability of heads  of entities is clear, that delegations are  formally accepted by heads of entities and  that heads of entities are well equipped  and informed to use their delegations A. PLAN Establish delegation of  authority  (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/Department of  Operational Support/head of  entity) B. DO Exercise delegation of  authority (Head of entity/Department of  Operational Support) C. CHECK Monitor delegation of  authority (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/head of entity) D. ACT Correct the exercise of or  suspend/amend/withdraw  delegation of authority  (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/Department of  Operational Support/head of  entity)   A/73/688    7/30  18-22826      (i)  Ensuring consistent measurement across the Secretariat to enable the  identification of systemic problems and opportunities to improve current  policies, processes and procedures;     (ii) Triggering a response to problems in how entities exercise their  delegations, for example, providing training or policy guidance or even  suspending, amending or revoking the delegated authority;    (iii) Generating lessons and good practices for continuous learning.        Going forward    19. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will manage and  oversee the quality of the monitoring framework, ensuring that the framework is  applied consistently across the Secretariat. The Division will also ensure that the  monitoring framework continuously improves and adapts to the needs of its users  through the addition of new key performance indicators or the discontinuation of  existing ones. The framework will need to evolve as the Secretariat's organizational  performance measurement capability matures through the full implementation and  stabilization of results-based management, enterprise risk management, Umoja  Extension 2 and innovations in the Division's data analytics capability.        B. Strengthening the implementation of results-based management       20. The Secretariat is making progress in implementing the detailed action plan for  the implementation of results-based management in the United Nations Secretariat,  2018-2021, in compliance with General Assembly resolution 72/303 (see annex II).        Progress to date     21.  In response to General Assembly resolution 72/266 A, in which the Assembly  approved changes to the budget procedures and format, a change management process  was implemented to support departments and special political missions in the  preparation of part II of the 2020 programme budget documents, which will contain the  programme plan for programmes and subprogrammes and programme performance  information. A total of 28 workshops were conducted, involving 1,500 staff. During the  sessions, programme managers received assistance in drafting the programme plan and  performance information to demonstrate how the Organization's work contributes  tangibly to planned results and how programme plans build on programme performance  and lessons learned, including from evaluations. Programme performance will be  assessed using both quantitative performance measures and qualitative information.   22. In 2018, the Secretary-General issued a communication to all senior managers  on the need to shift to a culture of results and included in the senior managers'  compacts for 2019 an indicator that will assess the contributions of senior managers  to the implementation of results-based management in their entities and to ensuring  the engagement of all staff in the implementation of the results-based management  action plan. In addition, the senior managers' compacts include an indicator that  requests senior managers to use the result frameworks included in their planning  documents as the starting point for the preparation of the annual workplans of staff.   23. As the oversight bodies have repeatedly emphasized, results-based management  also requires a strong link between programme performance and financial  performance. The new Umoja Extension 2 strategic planning, budgeting and  performance management solution is scheduled to go live in January 2019. At this  stage, the solution is to be used for the peacekeeping budgets for 2019/20, for  planning for activities funded by voluntary contributions for 2019 and for the  proposed programme budget for 2020.     A/73/688      18-22826  8/30        Going forward    24. The dedicated results-based management team of the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division will continue to support the Secretariat's efforts to  embed the concept of results-based management in the daily work of staff.   25. Umoja Extension 2 will enable a better assessment of whether the Organization  is using its resources efficiently and effectively. The strategic planning, budgeting  and performance management solution will support results-based management by  enabling better planning, execution and monitoring of, and reporting on, programme  delivery and will also link different elements of the programme plans to resources.  The performance dashboards developed for that purpose will be deployed  incrementally for administrative data and subsequently for performance data.         C. Establishing the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division       26. The new management paradigm is dependent on the Secretariat's ability to  ensure a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. Before the establishment of the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division, there was limited dedicated capacity and capability to  implement elements of the accountability system.         Progress to date    27. The final structure of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance has been designed. From 1 January 2019, the Department will work to  ensure that all key policies, processes and procedures are in place and operating  effectively. The new Business Transformation and Accountability Division will  provide dedicated support to managers and staff to help them to understand what is  expected with respect to governance, policy, risks and internal controls. Only then  can staff be held fully accountable. As a new entity, the Division will take time to  achieve full operational effectiveness.         Going forward     28. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will support the  Secretariat in the following ways:     (a)  Finalizing comprehensive guidance on the Secretariat's accountability  structures and operations;    (b)  Providing guidance and support for the delegation of authority and  systematic and frequent monitoring of the use of delegations and segregation of  duties;     (c)  Embedding the ""three lines of defence"" model in enterprise risk  management processes at all levels of the Secretariat;     (d)  Monitoring performance and compliance through data analytics and  introducing programme performance dashboards;     (e)  Strengthening self-evaluation activities, including through issuing policy  and guidelines;     (f)  Systematically conducting management reviews and quality assurance  exercises.         A/73/688    9/30  18-22826      III. Overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat      29. Pursuant to paragraph 19 of General Assembly resolution 72/303, this section  provides an overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat. The progress  made in strengthening the different elements that comprise the six components of the  accountability system is described, and key deliverables going forward are outlined.        Accountability system     30. Figure II illustrates the six components that comprise the core of the  Secretariat's accountability system, as embedded in the definition of accountability  provided in paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 64/259: (a) the Charter of  the United Nations; (b) the programme planning and budgetary documents of the  Organization; (c) results and performance; (d) internal control systems; (e) ethical  standards and integrity; and (f) oversight functions. A more detailed introduction to  the accountability system of the Secretariat, its components and interactions can be  found in the seventh progress report (see A/72/773, annex I).      A/73/688      18-22826  10/30    Figure II   Accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat       * External oversight bodies that provide independent assurance to the General Assembly.          Developing the overview of the status of accountability     31. In its related report on the accountability system (A/72/885), the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions concluded that the annual  progress reports on accountability should be enhanced to provide, in addition to  details and proposals on specific accountability policies, systems and mechanisms, an  overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat. This could include a set of  indicators to monitor overall trends and progress resulting from the implementation    A/73/688    11/30  18-22826    of the system of accountability (ibid., para. 53). The request for such an overview was  endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 72/303.  32. In response, the Secretariat has conducted a self-assessment using the following  two alternative methodologies:    (a)  The internal audit guide on assessing the effectiveness of an organization's  accountability framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors;1     (b)  The Joint Inspection Unit benchmarks contained in its report on  accountability frameworks in the United Nations system (A/66/710/Add.1).   33. The results and methodology used in the self-assessment will be provided to  Member States as supplementary information. In addition, the Secretariat intends to  undertake a self-evaluation to assess how the existing components are functioning to  inform the overview section in future accountability reports and to aid in the  development of key progress indicators that might result from the evaluation.         A. Component I: Charter of the United Nations       34. The Charter enshrines the basic principles of the Organization and identifies its  principal organs and their roles and responsibilities as well as those of the Secretary- General. The Charter, among other things, establishes that the Secretary-General is  the chief administrative officer of the United Nations (Article 97) and entrusts him  with implementing the mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United  Nations (Article 98). The General Assembly, in paragraph 6 of its resolution 72/303,  noted the importance of compliance with the Charter, its resolutions and the  regulations and rules as one of the essential components of accountability.  Strengthening the performance of the other five components will support this  objective.        B. Component II: programme planning and budget documents           Progress to date    35. In its resolution 72/266 A, the General Assembly decided that the proposed  programme budget document shall consist of the following three parts: (a) part I: the  plan outline, which endorses the long-term priorities and the objectives of the  Organization; (b) part II: the programme plan for programmes and subprogrammes  and programme performance information; and (c) part III: the post and non-post  resource requirements for the programmes and subprogrammes. The programme  budget for 2020 was prepared in accordance with this decision.         Going forward    36. Managers and staff members across the Secretariat will use the results-based  frameworks included in part II of the programme budget documents and other  planning and budgeting documents of the Organization (e.g., peacekeeping budgets)  as the starting point for preparing their annual workplans. Led by the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, this action will be implemented by  March 2019.    __________________    1  Marianne Avarello and Brian Bost, ""Internal audit guide on assessing the effectiveness of an  organization's accountability framework"", report to the Institute of Internal Auditors (Ottawa  Chapter), November 2003.  A/73/688      18-22826  12/30      C. Component III: results and performance         1.  Organizational performance    37. Taking into consideration the decisions of Member States and the findings and  recommendations of the oversight bodies related to results-based management,2 the  Secretary-General has identified strengthening the implementation of results-based  management in the Secretariat and holding managers and staff accountable for the  delivery of results as critical aspects for shifting the management paradigm.  38. In March 2018, the Secretary-General stated that, in order to enhance  transparency, and in line with the new competencies, leaders will be expected to use  data when establishing measurable key performance indicators. Senior leader  compacts will be linked to departmental, divisional, sectional, team-based and  individual workplans. Performance data will inform continuous performance dialogue  within departments, sections and teams and will be used to assess impact, readjust  approaches, develop staff and learn from mistakes to achieve better results  (A/72/492/Add.2, para. 15).        Progress to date    39. A new Analytics and Project Management Service of the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division has been designed to work with entities  to leverage the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja and other  enterprise solutions. The Division is to develop business analytics and visualization  tools to provide real-time support on performance to senior managers and other  stakeholders. Programme-specific performance management dashboards are under  construction to provide real-time information on resource utilization and programme  implementation that will: (a) ensure greater transparency; (b) increase awareness of  the extent to which programmes are achieving expected results; and (c) demonstrate  whether entities are using their resources effectively.        Going forward    40. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will provide  managers with timely and complete information to enable faster decision-making and  better service delivery to clients. This will be accompanied by training for staff to  improve their ability to use programme and financial information generated by  enterprise applications. The presentation of the results of the Organization's work is  being improved by including information on both planned and actual results to which  the respective subprogrammes contribute, allowing the link between results and  resources to be seen. This will be completed by 30 April 2019.  41. The data analytics team of the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division will design, develop and deploy specialized solutions to meet specific  requirements from managers and other stakeholders. The team will take advantage of  innovations in data analytics by applying statistical and algorithmic methods as well  as different approaches in data mining.       2.  Senior managers' compacts    42. The compacts between the Secretary-General and his senior managers are a key  element of the accountability system, becoming perhaps even more so following the  enhanced delegations of authority on 1 January 2019.   __________________    2  See, for example, A/69/5 (Vol. I), chap. II, A/71/5 (Vol. I) chap. II, and A/72/809.    A/73/688    13/30  18-22826    43. The compacts have been continuously improved since their introduction. For  example, in 2018, senior managers' compacts were strengthened to include: the  profile of leadership based on the United Nations system leadership framework  endorsed by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination  (CEB); a request to identify the top three risks of a department or mission and plans  for their mitigation; protections for whistle-blowers; the prevention of and response  to allegations of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; and diversity targets.         Progress to date    44. The compacts continue to be strengthened. The 2019 compacts include the  following:    (a)  An indicator of the implementation by senior managers of results-based  management and a requirement to report on expected results, progress updates and  course corrections, if necessary;     (b)  A requirement for senior managers to exercise the authority delegated to  them in compliance with regulations and rules and all relevant policies and guidelines.  45. A 360-degree evaluation mechanism focused on the nine leadership  characteristics that are essential to fulfilling the Organization's core mandates  (A/72/492, para. 17) was developed. Pilots were launched in December 2018, and the  360-degree evaluation for senior managers will be rolled out in 2019.   46. Management arrangements have also been enhanced. The compacts are  administered through an electronic system. From 1 January 2019, a dedicated team  under the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will be tasked with  the following:    (a)  Assessing performance against 2018 compact indicators;    (b)  Reviewing draft compacts for 2019 for compliance with guidance;     (c)  Supporting senior managers when requested;    (d)  Submitting the final compacts to the Secretary-General for approval.        Going forward     47. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will use data  analytics to improve the management of the Organization. It will monitor and assess  performance against the 2019 compact indicators, drawing on business insight from  performance dashboards and the monitoring of delegations of authority. The Division  will also work with senior managers to improve the new management arrangements,  the electronic system and the compacts themselves and make any necessary  adjustments in the 2020 cycle.       3.  Performance appraisal systems     48. The Secretary-General is committed to implementing an effective system of  incentives for strong performance, remedial action for underperformance and  sanctions for unsatisfactory behaviour and misconduct. The General Assembly, in its  resolution 70/244, requested the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) to  conduct a study on the performance management schemes in common system  organizations and to formulate recommendations on performance incentives. In  January 2018, the Assembly approved the Commission's recommendations in its  resolution 72/255.    A/73/688      18-22826  14/30        Progress to date    49. In April 2018, in response to the recommendations of ICSC, the Secretariat  consulted staff representatives and re-established the Staff-Management Committee  working group on performance management.  50. In September 2018, the Secretariat launched an online performance  management learning programme. The goal is to support managers in making  decisions when assessing performance and thus improve the current distribution of  ratings of performance.   51. The Office of Human Resources Management has conducted a gap analysis to  inform the next phases of improvement. The analysis identified major opportunities,  including the need:    (a)  To ensure staff goals align with the Organization's goals;    (b)  To strengthen the link among mobility, career development and  performance management, which will be further addressed in the mobility framework  to be presented during the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly;     (c)  To address the perceived subjectivity of evaluations provided by managers  during the appraisal process.         Going forward     52. The Office of Human Resources Management will develop options to respond  to the gap analysis. Effective systems of incentives for good performance and for the  application of remedial action and sanctions for underperformance will be  implemented by March 2020. Options include the following:    (a)  Integrating performance management into the organizational leadership  and management model to clarify what the Organization expects of managers;    (b)  Expanding training for managers and staff to include skills development  beyond process and policy;     (c)  Expanding efforts to build the capability of human resources practitioners  across the Secretariat in complex case management, the management of  underperformance and the provision of guidance on evaluations for managers and  staff members at their locations;    (d)  Enhancing the current e-performance system to strengthen managerial  accountability for performance;     (e)  Publishing data and trends on compliance with the requirements of  performance management and on the distribution of ratings of performance across the  Secretariat.        D. Component IV: internal control systems       53. The Secretariat is making progress in strengthening its internal control systems,  while also simplifying and streamlining them as described below.       1.  Regulations, rules, manuals, administrative issuances and standard  operating procedures         Progress to date     54. The Secretariat has made progress in simplifying and streamlining its human  resources, finance and programme support policy frameworks. Policies and processes    A/73/688    15/30  18-22826    have been redrafted to reflect the Umoja integration process and to clarify their  interpretation, on the basis of input provided by Secretariat staff across all duty  stations and field missions.  55. For example, the Staff Regulations and Rules have been reorganized, simplified  and made more user-friendly by removing duplications and placing operational details  in the administrative issuances. Progress has also been made in the revision of the  Staff Regulations and Rules to achieve gender parity, as proposed by the Secretary- General.   56. The first phase of amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules (A/73/378)  was submitted to the General Assembly for its consideration at the main part of the  seventy-third session. These efforts will be further expanded, with additional  amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules to be proposed to the Assembly in  2019 in respect of contractual arrangements and in 2020 in respect of conditions of  service.  57. Interim amendments to the Financial Rules have been issued to facilitate the  implementation of the new delegation of authority framework, and revisions to the  Financial Regulations to improve their alignment with the new management paradigm  have been submitted to the General Assembly for consideration. The amendments to  the Financial Regulations and Rules will be accompanied by changes to related  policies in the areas of budget and finance, procurement and property management.  58. The promulgation of new administrative instructions governing procurement  and the revision of the United Nations Procurement Manual to provide clear and  detailed guidance to all staff on the subject will be completed by 31 March 2019.       2.  Updating of legal instruments for engaging third parties     59. The Umoja grant management module was deployed at the end of 2018 and  includes the functionality to create standard template agreements with implementing  partners and end beneficiaries that will include anti-corruption and anti-fraud clauses.  In addition, the revised Financial Regulations and Rules that will be submitted to the  General Assembly in the first part of its resumed seventy-third session include the  proposal of new regulations and rules on implementing partners and end beneficiaries.  These revised regulations and rules will serve as the basis for formulating a  Secretariat-wide policy on the management of implementing partners and end  beneficiaries, including transparent application and selection processes, due  diligence, capacity assessment, project execution by partners and reporting.        Going forward    60. As indicated by the Secretary-General in his reports on shifting the management  paradigm, this effort to simplify regulations, rules, policies and procedures will be  accompanied by the establishment of an online compendium covering all areas of  administrative policy and the development of detailed user-friendly and readily  available case studies and decision trees to guide and support managers in this  process. The compendium will also allow users to quickly identify the current policy  and available guidance materials for any subject. Together with an online portal for  the management of delegation of authority, the compendium will support entities in  enhancing accountability in their exercise of delegation of authority.      3.  Enterprise risk management    61. In his previous progress report (A/72/773), the Secretary-General committed  himself to implementing in the Secretariat the ""three lines of defence"" model as  adopted by CEB. The model enhances the understanding of risk management and  A/73/688      18-22826  16/30    control of an organization by clarifying roles and duties and by providing guidance  for the implemented structure and the assigned roles and responsibilities of parties to  increase the effective management of risk and control.3         Progress to date     62. A dedicated enterprise risk management team has been designed in the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division to support entities in undertaking risk  assessment exercises to identify, evaluate and manage the specific risks that might  affect the functioning of their operations. The Division, which is to be the owner of  the Secretariat's risk management framework and methodology, will have the  following three main responsibilities:    (a)  Implementing Secretariat-wide risk assessment exercises and managing  the risks at the enterprise level;     (b)  Providing support, advice, training and guidance to operational managers  and staff in the first line of defence;     (c)  Creating and managing the register for all risks that have been identified  by heads of entity, identifying trends and patterns as well as successful risk mitigation  initiatives that have been implemented, and sharing lessons learned with managers in  the first line of defence.   63. A second Secretariat-wide risk assessment is being prepared with the active  participation of all Secretariat entities on the basis of the following past three  corporate risk assessment exercises implemented by the Organization:    (a)  The Secretariat-wide enterprise risk assessment (2014);    (b)  The fraud and corruption risk assessment (2018);    (c)  The risk assessment for the implementation of the management reform  (ongoing).   64. A single draft risk register for the entire Organization was prepared as the  starting point of the second Secretariat-wide risk assessment, conducted to update,  revise and validate the results of the three prior assessments. This will constitute the  comprehensive risk register of the Secretariat.         Going forward     65. Following the enhanced delegation of authority to heads of entities on 1 January  2019, the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will support the  Secretariat in embedding the ""three lines of defence"" model, inter alia, by preparing  a pamphlet underlining the responsibilities of every line of defence, by including a  training module on the subject in the induction training of staff members at all levels  and by including a chapter on the subject in the global accountability guidelines. The  responsibilities can be summarized as follows:     * The first line of defence is management. Heads of entities must identify specific  risk owners from their senior management teams for high priority risks  identified in the specific risk assessment exercises of their respective  departments, offices or missions. Risk owners are responsible for ensuring  controls systems are in place and operating effectively to mitigate risks. They  are also expected to escalate any deficiencies that might call for a review and  __________________    3  Enterprise Risk Management Initiative Faculty and Meredith Freeman, ""COSO's take on the  three lines of defense"", North Carolina State University, 26 June 2018. Available at  https://erm.ncsu.edu/library/article/cosos-take-on-the-three-lines-of-defense.    A/73/688    17/30  18-22826    redesign of the Secretariat's policies or controls and ideas to simplify policies  and processes as applicable, and/or automate them where practical, to heads of  entities, the Department of Operational Support and the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.     * The second line of defence is the Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance, the Office of Legal Affairs, the Ethics Office, the policy and  compliance functions of the Office of Information and Communications  Technology, the Department of Safety and Security and the areas of the  Department of Operational Support that provide operational advisory services  to clients to support the implementation of decisions. This line of defence  monitors and supports the implementation of effective risk management  practices by operational management, assisting risk owners in reporting and  escalating relevant risk-related information. In the Secretariat, this line is also  responsible for issuing policies that govern the Organization.    * The third line of defence is the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).  OIOS assists the Secretary-General in protecting the Organization's assets by  providing assurance that programme activities have led to the programmed  results and have been implemented in compliance with all relevant resolutions,  regulations, rules and policies of the Organization. It also plays a key role in  preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse, malfeasance and mismanagement.  OIOS conducts audits, evaluations, inspections and investigations, and its  reports are submitted directly to the General Assembly.   66. The Secretariat has an additional level of oversight, composed of two external  oversight bodies: the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit. In addition, the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee plays a key role.  67. A more detailed description of the ""three lines of defence"" model can be found  in section IV of the seventh progress report. The Business Transformation and  Accountability Division has developed a document outlining how the three lines of  defence work to mitigate risks, which will be provided to Member States as  supplementary information.       4.  Statement of internal control         Progress to date     68. The Office of the Controller and the internal control advisory group on  statements of internal control translated the 17 principles of the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission into the United Nations  environment and the implementation of the internal controls in Umoja. The issuance  of the statement of internal control and the deployment of the process to collect the  self-assessments from heads of entities will reflect the new delegations of authority  and their impact on business processes.         Going forward     69. A statement of internal control will be in place by the first quarter of 2021.  Under the statement, heads of entities will be required to sign a statement at the end  of each calendar year attesting to compliance with the internal control framework  under their areas of responsibility.      5.  Evaluation     70. In its resolution 72/303, the General Assembly emphasized that evaluation and  self-evaluation are essential managerial tools and that senior managers have the  responsibility to use evaluation and self-evaluation findings to improve performance  A/73/688      18-22826  18/30    and learning, and in this regard requested the Secretary-General to continue to take  concrete measures to enhance in-house capacity for self-evaluation, including  self-evaluation support within the Secretariat, taking advantage of the existing  knowledge and expertise of oversight bodies to ensure that all efforts are made to  avoid the duplication and/or overlapping of efforts.        Progress to date     71. In early 2019, the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will  issue guidelines to entities on the conduct of self-evaluations, containing the  following elements:    (a)  A clear explanation of the role of evaluation;    (b)  A clear definition of the institutional framework, roles and responsibilities;    (c)  An explanation of how evaluations are to be prioritized, planned and  budgeted;    (d)  An explanation of how evaluations are to be organized and managed and  how to ensure their quality;    (e)  The mechanisms for management response to and follow-up of  evaluations;    (f)  The dissemination and disclosure procedures for evaluations;    (g)  An explanation of how the guidelines will be operationalized;    (h)  An explanation of how evaluation capacities are to be developed and  maintained.  72. A dedicated evaluation team of the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division has been created. The team has developed a draft evaluation policy for the  Secretariat, which is due to be finalized following consultation. In addition, the  Division is to help entities to develop their evaluation plans for 2019 and 2020.         Going forward     73. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division evaluation team will  have the following responsibilities:    (a)  Owning the Secretariat's evaluation policy and procedures and overseeing  the quality of their implementation across the Secretariat, ensuring that all functioning  evaluation units adopt the new policy;    (b)  Owning the Secretariat's annual evaluation plan, built on the basis of plans  from individual entities;    (c)  Developing and continuously improving the methods and standard tool  box to be used in different types of evaluations;    (d)  Identifying or developing and delivering a suite of training materials and  opportunities and offer a mentoring service;     (e)  Developing and maintaining a roster of external and qualified internal  evaluation experts who would be released by their parent units to undertake short  evaluation and assurance assignments (June 2019);    (f)  Supporting entities in developing high-quality terms of reference and in  ensuring the quality of draft evaluation reports for departments and offices that might  require assistance;     A/73/688    19/30  18-22826      (g)  Developing a virtual ""community of practice"" in which evaluation  specialists or those interested in developing evaluation skills can communicate;    (h)  Performing trend analyses of results and findings across the Secretariat to  improve the delivery of results, extract lessons and feed into the continuum of  improvement.      6.  Oversight coordination         Progress to date     74. A dedicated team has been designed in the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division that will be responsible for providing continuous monitoring  and follow-up services regarding the implementation of oversight recommendations.  The team will inform the Management Committee and the Independent Audit  Advisory Committee of the status of implementation on a quarterly basis.         Going forward     75. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will conduct reviews  of the reports of oversight bodies every six months to identify trends and systemic  issues that might be affecting the functioning of the Organization, to be used as the  basis for comprehensive solutions to Secretariat-wide problems. The first review will  be prepared by 30 June 2019.      7.  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat     76. In September 2016, the first Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat (ST/IC/2016/25) was issued. In 2017, the Secretariat  conducted a fraud and corruption risk assessment to identify the most critical areas at  risk of fraud and corruption to inform a comprehensive anti-fraud and anti-corruption  strategy, addressing a long-standing concern of the Board of Auditors that the  Secretariat had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment regarding fraud (see  A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II, sect. H)        Progress to date     77. The Secretariat implemented an enterprise-wide campaign against fraud and  corruption as described in paragraphs 28 and 29 of the sixth progress report  (A/71/729). However, as noted by the Board of Auditors (A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II,  para. 294), there is a still a need to reinforce the awareness of staff of the fraud risks  faced by the Organization.   78. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 70/238 A, the High-Level Committee  on Management, on the basis of its consultations with the Representatives of Internal  Audit Services of the United Nations Organizations and the United Nations  Representatives of Investigations Services, adopted common definitions of fraud and  presumptive fraud in March 2017. The agreed common definitions can be employed  by individual organizations, as appropriate, within their respective regulatory  frameworks, legal instruments and policies and in accordance with their specific  requirements.        Going forward     79. Although the update and review of the Secretariat's risk register is proving to  be useful at Headquarters, there is still a need to raise awareness and understanding  of fraud and corruption risks in the field. The Secretariat is using the opportunities  for supporting the offices in the field to increase awareness of that issue. The  completion of risk assessments of most individual entities will enable the  A/73/688      18-22826  20/30    development and implementation of a Secretariat-wide anti-fraud and anti-corruption  strategy, which is at the core of a set of recommendations on the matter issued by the  Board of Auditors (see A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II).      8.  Conduct and discipline         Progress to date     80. In compliance with General Assembly resolution 59/287, the Secretariat  published a compendium of disciplinary measures, outlining the practice of the  Secretary-General in disciplinary matters and cases of criminal behaviour from 1 July  2009 to 31 December 2017. 4  The compendium describes long-term trends in  misconduct and/or criminal behaviour and their disciplinary consequences, including  the following:    (a)  The number of staff subject to disciplinary measures increased more than  threefold, from 24 in the 12-month period ended 30 June 2009 to 79 in the 12-month  period ended 30 June 2017;    (b)  The number of staff that have been either separated or dismissed owing to  misconduct also increased more than threefold, from 15 in the 12-month period ended  30 June 2009 to 50 in the 12-month period ended 30 June 2017;    (c)  Of the total of 428 cases of misconduct listed in the report for the period  under consideration, about 50 per cent fell under three categories of misconduct: 94  cases (21 per cent) under fraud, misrepresentation and false certification; 72 cases (17  per cent) under theft and misappropriation; and 55 cases (12 per cent) under assault  (verbal and physical).         Going forward     81. All incidents of misconduct are taken seriously by the Secretariat. The increase  in disciplinary measures and the sanctions of separation or dismissal could be the  result of a control environment that is being strengthened, including an improved  investigations function that provides the basis for the decision to sanction. The  Secretariat will continue to monitor and analyse this information and include its  conclusions in the following accountability report.        E. Component V: ethical standards and integrity       82. The Secretary-General is committed to ensuring an environment in which staff  feel safe to report wrongdoing and to protecting them against retaliation when they  do so. Staff are the first to recognize wrongdoing in the workplace; empowering them  to speak up without fear of reprisal will therefore help to prevent, detect, deter,  respond to and enable reporting on misconduct, fraud and corruption.   83. Progress had been made prior to the reporting period. A significantly  strengthened policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for  cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations (ST/SGB/2017/2) was  promulgated on 20 January 2017, and a revised policy went into effect on  28 November 2017 (ST/SGB/2017/2/Rev.1).       1.  Protection from retaliation     84. The action taken by the Ethics Office towards protection against retaliation in  the period from 1 January to 31 December 2017 is detailed in the relevant report of  __________________    4  With the exception of a period of six months from 1 July 2017 to 31 December 2017.    A/73/688    21/30  18-22826    the Secretary-General (A/73/89, paras. 50-58). During that period, the Ethics Office  received 92 enquiries under the policy on protection against retaliation. Of those, 48  were not claims for protection, but rather requests for advice, while 9 were outside  the Office's jurisdiction. The Office initiated 26 preliminary reviews during the  reporting period. As at 31 December 2017, 22 cases had been completed and 1 claim  had been abandoned. With respect to the 22 completed preliminary reviews, 14 claims  did not present a prima facie case. Most of the cases concerned workplace disputes  between the complainants and their colleagues or supervisors.  85. The 2018 Leadership Dialogue, on the topic ""Speaking up: when does it become  whistle-blowing?"", was launched on 27 August 2018. Further details of the outreach,  training and educational activities undertaken by the Ethics Office during the reporting  period are provided in the report of the Secretary-General (ibid., paras. 59-66).       2.  Preventing sexual exploitation and abuse     86. In his first major report on the topic (A/71/818, A/71/818/Corr.1 and  A/71/818/Add.1), the Secretary-General set out a strategy to prevent and respond to  sexual exploitation and abuse committed by those serving under the United Nations  flag.         Progress to date     87. Progress in implementing the strategy has continued, as described in the report  of the Secretary-General on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation  and abuse (A/72/751 and A/72/751/Corr.1). The key achievements are: (a) the  extension of the mandate of the Special Coordinator on Improving the United Nations  Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse until 31 December 2018; and (b) the  appointment of a victims' rights advocate in September 2017 to enhance coordination  and ensure sustained high-level attention to the issue.   88. All United Nations entities with a field presence are required to develop action  plans and risk mitigation strategies against sexual exploitation and abuse and to  submit them annually to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General. Senior  managers must also submit annual certifications to the Secretary-General that all  credible allegations related to United Nations staff and affiliated personnel have been  fully and accurately reported. Certification is required regarding the provision of  training on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse and reporting allegations. A risk  management toolkit was rolled out for use in all field operations in June 2018.  89. The Secretary-General has also strengthened reporting, investigations and  transparency to ensure that there is no impunity for those who engage in those types  of activities. An incident reporting form has been introduced to ensure system-wide  uniformity in the collection of initial information on allegations of sexual exploitation  and abuse. The form is aimed at initiating a formal process within the United Nations  system in response to an allegation or report and determining the appropriate action,  such as an administrative investigation and/or a referral for criminal investigation. To  ensure transparency, the spokesperson of the Secretary General provides quarterly  public updates on allegations received by all entities that are mandated to report to  the General Assembly.5   90. In 2017, the Secretariat developed a new mandatory online training course  entitled ""Prevention of sexual harassment and abuse by United Nations personnel -  working harmoniously"", which is available to all staff members.   __________________    5  Available at www.un.org/preventing-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse/content/quarterly-updates.   A/73/688      18-22826  22/30    91. Since June 2018, a screening tool, Clear Check, has been used across the United  Nations system to prevent personnel connected with substantiated allegations of  sexual exploitation and abuse, or those who leave the United Nations during an  investigation, from being rehired. The same screening platform is being used for  sexual harassment cases. The Secretary-General has also issued the protocol on  allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse involving implementing partners.      3.  Combating sexual harassment     92. Ensuring that staff who have been subjected to or witnessed sexual harassment  feel safe and empowered to speak up is imperative, as is ensuring that appropriate  mechanisms are in place to prevent, investigate and respond to such incidents and  provide protection for victims and witnesses.   93. The Secretary-General has mobilized senior managers to improve guidance,  information and services for staff, with an emphasis on improving support for victims.  Such measures include the 24-hour ""Speak up"" helpline in the Secretariat, an updated  mandatory training programme and an information note on available reporting  mechanisms and services.   94. The Secretariat led a system-wide survey entitled ""Safe space: survey on sexual  harassment in our workplace"" across 31 United Nations and related organizations in  November 2018. The survey, administered in the six official languages, was  completed by 30,493 staff and non-staff. The results are being used to guide evidence- based policymaking.   95. Efforts are also under way to strengthen the investigation and response  capacities of OIOS in areas such as improving the quality of investigation reports and  harmonizing standard operating procedures. In February 2018, OIOS implemented a  streamlined, fast-tracked procedure to process and address all sexual harassment  complaints as category I allegations. A specialized team focusing on investigations of  sexual harassment was created.   96. The CEB task force on addressing sexual harassment promotes the  harmonization of sexual harassment policies and accelerates efforts to increase the  capacity and quality of investigations and victims' protection and support  mechanisms across the United Nations system. The task force works with Member  States to ensure mutual support for initiatives in this area. In the first year since its  inception, the task force has achieved significant progress, including the adoption of  a system-wide model policy on sexual harassment and the launch of a system-wide  sexual harassment screening tool.         F. Component VI: oversight functions       97. The status of implementation of the recommendations of OIOS and the Board  of Auditors is outlined in annex I.      1.  Office of Internal Oversight Services     98. The following three positive trends have been noted in the implementation of  recommendations issued by OIOS during the period from 2008 to 2017:    (a)  Of a total of 12,715 recommendations, 11,637 recommendations (some 91  per cent) have been either implemented or closed by the Secretariat. Only 1,078 (8.5  per cent) of recommendations remain under implementation;     (b)  Of a total of 2,586 critical recommendations, 2,559 recommendations (99  per cent) have been implemented or closed by the Secretariat;    A/73/688    23/30  18-22826      (c)  The number of critical recommendations issued by OIOS decreased during  the period.       2.  Board of Auditors     99. In respect of recommendations issued by the Board of Auditors in volumes I and  II of the financial reports and audited financial statements of the United Nations, the  following positive trends have been noted for the period from 2008 to 2017:     (a)  Of a total of 798 recommendations, 667 recommendations (82 per cent)  have been either implemented by the Secretariat or overtaken by events;    (b)  Only 131 (16 per cent) of recommendations remain under implementation.       3.  Joint Inspection Unit     100. In respect of recommendations issued by the Joint Inspection Unit, the following  trend can be reported for the period from 2008 to 2018: 6  the rate of accepted  recommendations by the Secretariat was 61 per cent, while the rate of implementation  of accepted recommendations was 83 per cent.7   101. Those rates may not reflect the real status of implementation of  recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit to the Secretariat, however, as some  recommendations, although addressed to the General Assembly and to the Secretary- General as Chair of CEB, are counted as recommendations to the Secretariat.         IV. Conclusion       102. The new management paradigm depends on the Secretariat's ability to  undertake a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. Achieving a culture shift of such significance will not  happen overnight, and although progress has been made, more remains to be done in  2019 to further strengthen the system. The Secretariat looks forward to receiving  guidance from Member States to continue with this important initiative.         V. Recommendation to the General Assembly       103. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the progress made and  the plans to further strengthen the Secretariat's accountability system, as  described in the present report.        __________________    6  As at Wednesday, 14 November 2018.    7  The Joint Inspection Unit database does not allow users to extract the number of  recommendations, only the percentage.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/75/804      General Assembly    Distr.: General  8 March 2021    Original: English    21-03167 (E)    100321  *2103167*      Seventy-fifth session      Agenda item 139      Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations                 Tenth progress report on accountability: strengthening  accountability in the United Nations Secretariat         Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions        I. Introduction      1.  The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has  considered the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Tenth progress report on  accountability: strengthening accountability in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/75/686), submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 74/271. During its  consideration of the report, the Committee met online with representatives of the  Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding  with written responses received on 25 February 2021.  2.  Since its sixtieth session, held in 2005, the General Assembly has addressed the  importance of accountability and of ensuring greater accountability in the Secretariat,  including in its resolutions 60/260, 63/276 and 64/259. During the sixty-sixth session  of the Assembly, held in 2012, the Secretary-General submitted his first annual report  on progress towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat for  the consideration of Member States. To date, the Secretary-General has submitted  10 such progress reports (A/75/686, A/74/658, A/73/688 and A/73/688/Corr.1,  A/72/773, A/71/729, A/70/668, A/69/676, A/68/697, A/67/714 and A/66/692). In his  tenth progress report, the Secretary-General describes the overall framework of the  accountability system of the United Nations Secretariat and presents information on  various ongoing or planned reviews, pilots, initiatives and technical enhancements of  Umoja and other systems, as well as a description of already available qualitative and  quantitative data depositories and related statistical information. In section II below,  the Advisory Committee addresses selected matters in this regard.  3.  The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 8 of  its resolution 64/259, decided that the definition of accountability, which remains in  effect, would be as follows:  A/75/804      21-03167  2/8    Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be  answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or exception.  Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a timely  and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all mandates  to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies and  other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and  resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of  rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important role of the  oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted recommendations.  4.  Since the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee  has continued to provide extensive observations and recommendations in its reports  on the accountability system, as well as in a wide range of reports with an  accountability dimension.1 The Advisory Committee considers that the concept of  an accountability system should represent a critical pillar of the Organization  with a central role in all reform efforts, as well as in all organizational,  administrative and operational changes, and should be anchored by the  aforementioned definition of accountability, which has remained in place since  the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  5.  The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General has endeavoured to  develop a strong culture of accountability that would be sustainable and holistic  throughout the United Nations Secretariat. The Advisory Committee recommends  that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to focus future  progress reports on the practical aspects of institutional and personal  accountability. In the progress reports, the Secretary-General should therefore  elaborate on the operationalization and reporting of the specific outcomes and  results of the processes and measures that are meant to promote accountability,  including statistical information, and the assessment of their impact. This should  include clearly transparent sets of parameters, including an actionable system of  measures,2 in accordance with the established definition of accountability,  relevant staff regulations and rules, and applicable policies and instructions, as  well as with the guidance provided by intergovernmental bodies, internal and  external oversight bodies, and the Charter of the United Nations.3 Furthermore,  __________________    1 These include the Advisory Committee's previous reports on accountability(A/74/741, A/73/800,  A/72/885, A/71/820, A/70/770, A/69/802, A/68/783, A/67/776, A/66/738; and A/64/683 and  A/64/683/Corr.1, A/63/457 and A/60/418) and its other related reports, including those on:  management reform (A/75/538, A/74/7/Add.32, A/74/7/Add.7, A/73/411, A/72/7/Add.49 and  A/72/7/Add.24); activities of the Ethics Office (A/74/539); special measures for protection from  sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (A/74/788, A/73/828, A/72/824 and A/71/643); the global  field support strategy (A/69/874);  the global service delivery model (A/73/791, A/72/7/Add.50,  A/71/666 and A/70/436); human resources management (A/75/765, A/73/497, A/73/183,  A/71/557, A/70/718, A/69/572 and A/68/523); disciplinary matters (A/75/776 and A/74/558);  amendments to staff regulations and rules (A/74/732 and A/73/622); financial reports and audited  financial statements and reports of the Board of Auditors (A/75/539, A/74/528 and  A/74/528/Corr.1, A/73/430, A/72/537, A/71/669, A/70/380, A/69/386 and A/68/381); the  enterprise resource planning project (Umoja) (A/75/7/Add.14, A/74/7/Add.17, A/72/7/Add.31,  A/71/628, A/70/7/Add.19, A/69/418, A/68/7/Add.7 and A/67/565); and procurement activities  (A/73/790, A/71/823, A/69/809,  A/67/801 and A/64/501).    2 As indicated in paragraph 3 of the present report, the definition of accountability includes all  aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions.     3 The conduct of staff of the Secretariat is guided by chapter XV of the Charter of the United  Nations.    A/75/804    3/8  21-03167    the Committee trusts that the findings of the ongoing evaluation by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services (see para. 6 below) will also address the  aforementioned matters.        II. Observations and recommendations of the  Advisory Committee        1.  Reviews by internal and external oversight bodies        Office of Internal Oversight Services    6.  The Secretary-General indicates that the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (OIOS) is currently conducting an evaluation of the United Nations accountability  system to determine the extent to which the system is relevant, efficient and effective  in ensuring that the Secretariat: (a) fully implements all mandates approved by the  intergovernmental bodies and subsidiary organs; and (b) produces high-quality results  in a timely and efficient manner. This review will be finalized by June 2021  (A/75/686, para. 5). For this purpose, a questionnaire with respect to the changes in  workload and responsibilities resulting from the enhanced delegation of authority was  developed and integrated into the OIOS evaluation (ibid., para. 57). Upon enquiry,  the Advisory Committee was informed that the scope of the evaluation included an  in-depth analysis of the main elements of the four components of the accountability  system, namely: component II: programme, planning and budget documents;  component III: results and performance; component IV: internal control systems; and  component V: ethical standards and integrity. The other two components, the Charter  of the United Nations (component I) and oversight functions (component VI) are not  included in the evaluation. The Committee was furthermore informed that it was  expected that the results of the evaluation would provide a road map for the  Secretariat to review and adjust any components that might not be functioning as  intended.  7.  As indicated by the Secretary-General in his report, the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance has been operationalized and has undertaken a  number of activities, including a review of the 16 key performance indicators; an  analysis of procurement functions to identify inaccurately issued subdelegations and  ensure alignment between Umoja roles requiring a subdelegation and the related  subdelegations in the delegation of authority portal; quarterly checks to identify  conflicting delegations of authority; and the introduction of a training programme for  staff with delegated responsibilities (A/75/686, paras. 50-60).  8.  The Advisory Committee looks forward to the results of the evaluation by  the Office of Internal Oversight Services, including on the role and the  functioning of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and expects that  the related findings will be presented in the eleventh progress report of the  Secretary-General on the accountability system.        Joint Inspection Unit    9.  Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, in 2021, the Joint  Inspection Unit would conduct a system-wide assessment of the accountability  frameworks of United Nations system organizations. The Advisory Committee looks  forward to the results of the review by the Joint Inspection Unit and trusts that  the Secretary-General will address the related findings in conjunction with the  A/75/804      21-03167  4/8    results of the aforementioned evaluation, in particular as they relate to lessons  learned and best practices from other United Nations system organizations.        Board of Auditors    10. The observations and recommendations of the Board of Auditors are contained  in its annual reports on the financial reports and audited financial statements of the  United Nations, relating to volume I (United Nations) and volume II (peacekeeping  operations). The Advisory Committee recalls that it has stressed that the full and  timely implementation of recommendations of oversight bodies is an integral  part of the accountability system, in particular of performance evaluations in the  context of senior managers' compacts, and that the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division should ensure the use of lessons learned and data  analysis as a result of oversight bodies' reports (see A/74/741, paras. 36-37). A  long-term analysis of the recommendations that were issued by the Board of Auditors  over a 10-year period indicates a number of recurring issues pertaining to property  management, human resources management and financial management, as well as the  cost-effective use of resources (A/75/686, paras. 102-112). The Advisory Committee  intends to follow up on long-outstanding recommendations in its current  consideration of the report of the Board of Auditors on the financial report and audited  financial statements of United Nations peacekeeping operations for the 12-month  period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 (A/75/5 (Vol. II), and in its consideration,  during the fourth quarter of 2021, of the report of the Board of Auditors on the  financial reports and audited financial statements of the United Nations for the year  ended 31 December 2020 (A/76/5 (Vol. I).  11.  The Secretary-General indicates that the statement of internal control will be  issued in 2021 for 2020 for all entities, including field operations of the Secretariat,  and that the Board of Auditors will be consulted in its implementation (A/75/686,  paras. 74-78). The Advisory Committee notes that the statement of internal  control has not yet been implemented and looks forward to the review of the  Board of Auditors once the statement has been operationalized.        Intergovernmental bodies    12. Progress in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 74/271 and a  summary of the status of implementation of resolutions on administrative and  budgetary matters adopted by the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session are set out,  respectively, in annexes I and II of the report of the Secretary-General. The Advisory  Committee notes that a number of matters remain a work-in-progress and  stresses the importance of timely implementation of the decisions and  recommendations of intergovernmental bodies, including the recommendations  of the Committee which were endorsed by the General Assembly in its relevant  resolutions.      2.  Activities, initiatives and pilot projects    13. A summary of the progress in the implementation of the action plan for the  implementation of results-based management in the United Nations Secretariat from  2018 to 2021 is set out in annex III of the report of the Secretary-General. The  Advisory Committee notes that the accountability system is being continuously  enhanced and refined with new measures and concepts, for example, through  streamlining policies and providing additional technical capabilities and data mining  resources, aimed at strengthening the overall accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat. The Advisory Committee considers that it is not evident how,  and if, the totality of the activities, initiatives and pilot projects are linked to the  development of a strong culture of accountability in the United Nations    A/75/804    5/8  21-03167    Secretariat and to the ongoing oversight of the delegation of authority. The  Committee recalls its view that it is essential to align workplans with approved  programme activities arising from established mandates, while also monitoring  the performance and accountability of individuals and entities against the  implementation of mandated activities (A/75/765, paras. 27-28). The Committee  recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to  provide information, including on how the implementation of results-based  management and results-based budgeting and their potential alignment across  the three related sources of funding can come together to form a sustainable and  holistic system of accountability.  14. Furthermore, as part of the Umoja Extension 2, the performance dashboard was  rolled out to peacekeeping missions, with a visual link between the strategic plan,  programme performance and budget consumption, and post incumbency data.  (A/75/686, paras. 15-20). Also, the two-year pilot project of the Comprehensive  Performance Assessment System was completed in July 2020, in close consultation  with eight field missions, whose feedback confirmed that the system had met its  objective as an effective tool and had improved integration among the civilian, police  and military components. (ibid., paras. 15-21). The Advisory Committee recalls  that the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of resolution 74/271, encouraged the  Secretary-General to further increase the use of data to inform decision-making  and improve organizational performance, and to report on the impact of the  effective use of data on shifting the Organization to a culture of results in his  next progress report. The Committee notes the efforts to strengthen the  accountability system with new initiatives and data mining approaches. The  Committee looks forward to the findings of the evaluation currently being  conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Committee trusts  that information thereon will be provided in the next progress report of the  Secretary-General.      3.  Human resources        Senior managers' compacts    15. The Secretary-General indicates that new indicators have recently been included  in the senior managers' compacts, including with respect to the statement of internal  controls; providing a safe and healthy workplace for mission personnel; the  consideration of placement of qualified staff affected by downsizing; and  strengthening the area of leadership accountability on conduct and discipline,  including preventing and addressing sexual exploitation and abuse of authority. The  Secretary-General indicates that, with regard to timely submission of documentation  to the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, in 2019,  92 per cent of senior managers have met the threshold of 90 per cent of documentation  submitted on time (ibid., paras. 26-30). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was  informed that all senior managers were required to provide all documentation for the  consideration of the Committee no later than the scheduled submission dates agreed  by the Committee.  16. The Advisory Committee notes that the indicator on the implementation of  oversight body recommendations in the compacts of senior managers will be  strengthened and trusts this will result in increased efforts by senior managers  in implementing the recommendations of oversight bodies. The Committee  considers, however, that the reported high rate of timely submission of  documentation still does not reflect the operational reality of the oftentimes  delayed submission of documents by the secretariat to the Committee. The  Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 16 of resolution  74/271, reiterated, inter alia, that the timely submission of documents is an  A/75/804      21-03167  6/8    important aspect of the accountability of the Secretariat to Member States, and  requested the Secretary-General to ensure the continued inclusion in the senior  managers' compacts of a related managerial indicator, and to provide  information in his next progress report on how this indicator is used to improve  senior managers' accountability in the timely submission of documents (see also  A/74/741, paras. 37-39). The Committee also recalls that, in its previous report,  it stressed that failure to hold senior managers to account has a negative impact  on the enforcement of accountability among staff at every level (ibid., para. 20).  The Advisory Committee has provided further comments on senior managers'  compacts in its report on the overview of human resources management reform for  the period 2019-2020 and an outlook beyond (A/75/765, paras. 29-30).        Performance appraisal and management    17. The Advisory Committee recalls its view that the current performance ratings  distribution, with over 99 per cent of staff members rated under the two categories of  ""exceeds expectations"" or ""meets expectations"" (A/75/765, paras. 31-36), may not  be an accurate reflection of staff performance (A/74/741, para. 24). The Committee  was informed, upon enquiry, that the pilot for the so-called agile performance  management approach, aimed at improving the objectivity and credibility of the  performance management framework, has been concluded, with the outcome  currently under review and a roll-out date in the 2021-2022 performance cycle (see  also A/75/686, paras. 31-36). The Advisory Committee recalls its recommendation  in its report on the overview of human resources management reform for the  period 2019-2020 and an outlook beyond, that more information and clarification  should be provided to the General Assembly on the current pilot implementation  phase of the performance management system improvements, such as the  consideration of introducing a grading curve for performance ratings, as well as  the financial implications, if any (see also A/75/765, paras. 35-36).        Staff engagement survey (2019)    18. The Secretary-General indicates that more than 18,000 staff members (or 52 per  cent of staff) participated in the second staff engagement survey conducted in 2019  (A/75/686, paras. 47-49). The results showed that only 49 per cent of staff responded  favourably to the question ""People at all levels in the United Nations Secretariat are  treated with respect"". The Advisory Committee stresses that senior managers are  responsible and accountable for ensuring that staff are treated with respect and  work in a conducive environment.      4.  Managing the risk of fraud and corruption        Cross-functional task force and preparation of the anti-fraud and  anti-corruption guidebook    19. A fraud and corruption risk assessment conducted in 2019, as part of the overall  Secretariat-wide risk assessment, highlighted six critical risks related to fraud and  corruption: (a) organizational culture; (b) information and communications  technology governance and cybersecurity; (c) implementing partners; (d) the Umoja  system control environment; (e) the theft of fuel, rations and inventory; and  (f) procurement fraud. After the task force, which was established to prepare an  anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook, was suspended owing to the coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) pandemic, all issues related to the examination of anti-fraud and  anti-corruption matters were assigned to a working group of the Secretariat-wide risk  assessment. In addition, in March 2020, the High-Level Committee on Management,  at its thirty-ninth session, endorsed the establishment of a cross-functional task force  on managing fraud risk, which has also considered the best practices on fraud risk    A/75/804    7/8  21-03167    management, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, the  Secretariat plans to, inter alia: (a) define risk treatment and response plans for all  critical risks, inducing fraud and corruption risks by the end of the first quarter of  2021; and (b) prepare the aforementioned anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook  and strategy by the end of the second quarter of 2021, as also recommended by the  Board of Auditors (A/75/686, paras. 69-75).  20. The Advisory Committee looks forward to an update, in the context of the  next progress report of the Secretary-General, on the work of the  cross-functional task force on managing fraud risk. Furthermore, the Committee  trusts that details with respect to the anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook  and strategy, including how the guidelines will be disseminated and how their  implementation will be monitored, will be presented in the next progress report.  The Advisory Committee intends to further follow up on fraud- and corruption-related  matters during its consideration, in the fourth quarter of 2021, of the report of the  Board of Auditors on the financial reports and audited financial statements of the  United Nations for the year ended 31 December 2020.        Guidelines for implementing partners    21. The Advisory Committee recalls that that the guidelines for agreements with  implementing partners were to be issued in March 2020 (see A/74/741, para. 29) and  notes that issuance of the final version of the guidelines is now planned for the second  quarter of 2021 (A/75/686, paras. 61-62). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed  that the guidelines would be issued specifically for United Nations Secretariat entities  and would take into account the Secretariat's legislative framework, regulations,  rules, policies and business processes, and also address fraud-related risks. The  Advisory Committee trusts that an update on the details with respect to the  guidelines for agreements with implementing partners, including how they will  be disseminated and their implementation monitored, will be presented in the  next progress report.      5.  Environmental sustainability    22. The Advisory Committee notes that the subject of an environmentally  sustainable Secretariat has not been included in the present progress report of the  Secretary-General but recalls that the subject was addressed in the ninth progress  report, in which a number of related steps were described, including: (a) the  promulgation of an environmental policy for the United Nations Secretariat (see  ST/SGB/2019/7); and (b) the adoption by the Secretariat of its own climate action  plan, including a 45 per cent reduction in the Secretariat's carbon footprint by 2030.  Concerning the carbon neutrality of the United Nations, at that time, the Committee  was informed, upon enquiry, that the Organization's annual performance on  greenhouse gas emissions was measured as part of the United Nations system  environmental inventory initiative, which is coordinated by the United Nations  Environment Programme4 (A/74/741, paras. 16-17). Upon enquiry, the Committee  was informed that the efforts to achieve an environmentally sustainable Secretariat  currently included the second phase (2020-2023) of the implementation of the  environment strategy for field missions; and standard operating procedures for peace  operations on waste management plans and on energy infrastructure management  plans. The Committee was furthermore informed, also upon enquiry, that the main  achievements of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division included  promulgating an environmental policy for the United Nations Secretariat in  __________________    4 The most recent report on greenhouse gas emissions is available at www.greeningtheblue.org/  reports/greening-blue-report-2020.  A/75/804      21-03167  8/8    September 2019; the adoption by the Secretariat of its own climate action plan, which  sets eight targets, including a 45 per cent reduction in the Secretariat's carbon  footprint by 2030; and the achievement in 2019 of the Secretariat's carbon neutrality  certificate for its global operations.  23. The Advisory Committee trusts that environmental sustainability will  extend to the entire United Nations Secretariat. The Committee recommends that  the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to include in future  progress reports specific information on outcomes, results and financial  implications, including costs and benefits for the United Nations Secretariat and  for peacekeeping operations. The Committee will continue to address the matter of  environmental sustainability and management in various contexts, including in the  context of its report on the proposed programme budget for 2022 and in its report on  observations and recommendations on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping  operations, as well as in its reports on individual peacekeeping missions.      6.  Impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic    24. As described in the report of the Secretary-General, the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic in 2020 has impacted the progress in some accountability-related measures,  such as the implementation of the second phase of the agile performance management  pilot, which was temporarily delayed but has now proceeded (A/75/686, para. 32).  The Secretary-General also indicates that the Secretariat plans to engage with the  main groups of Member States on the format of the proposed programme budget for  2022 and that the respective budget proposals and performance reports will  incorporate information on the impact of the liquidity crisis and the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, as per General Assembly resolutions 75/243 and  75/252. The Committee was furthermore informed that the COVID-19-related impact  on the accountability efforts and their progress was a result of the change of working  methods, with mandatory telecommuting, as well as the need to redirect internal  human resources capacity to address a number of urgent administrative needs  regarding COVID-19, such as the preparation of new COVID-19-related  administrative guidelines and policy guidance.  25. The Advisory Committee recalls its comments and recommendations on the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its first report on the proposed programme  budget for 2021, including its request that the Secretary-General provide more  information on the impact of the pandemic in the next proposed programme budget,  inter alia, on lessons learned, best practices, efficiency measures, harmonization and  cooperation across the United Nations system (A/75/7, chap. I, paras. 12-15).        III. Recommendations      26. The action requested by the Secretary-General to be taken by the General  Assembly is set out in paragraph 115 of the report of the Secretary-General. With  respect to the evaluation of the United Nations accountability system, currently  conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and to be concluded in  June 2021, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly  request the Secretary-General to present the findings, including any financial  implications, in the eleventh progress report on the accountability system.  Subject to its observations and recommendations in the paragraphs above, the  Committee recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to  present in future progress reports, the specific outcomes (including specific  instances when staff and senior managers were held accountable and the  resulting actions), quantitative and qualitative results, and associated costs, as  they pertain to the various components of the accountability system.

In the  case of the United Nations, the Unit shall, when possible, in- dicate to which organs of the United Nations a report is of  essential concern and the Secretary-General shall take this into  account when distributing it. The Advisory Committee on Ad- ministrative and Budgetary Questions shall receive all reports  for information. As it deems appropriate, the Advisory Com- mittee may choose to issue comments and observations on any  of the reports which fall within its competence;  ( e)  When a report concerns more than one organization,  the respective executive heads shall, normally within the frame- work of the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination, con- sult with one another and, to the extent possible, co-ordinate  their comments. The report, together with the joint comments  and any comments of the respective executive heads on matters  that concern their particular organizations, shall be ready for  submission to the competent organs of the organizations not  later than six months after receipt of the Unit's report for  consideration at the next meeting of the competent organs  concerned.

Notes and confidential letters shall be submitted to  executive heads for use by them as they may decide.  Article 12  Executive heads of organizations shall ensure that recom- mendations of the Unit approved by their respective competent  organs are implemented as expeditiously as possible. Such im- plementation may be subject to verification by the competent  organs of the organizations, which may also request the Unit  to issue follow-up reports. The Unit may also prepare such  reports on its own initiative.

"accountability","Administrative Instruction on Evaluation United Nations Secretariat Guidelines TABLE OF CONTENTS 01 13 11 15 05 14 13 II - Evaluation Procedures I - A New Administrative Instruction for Evaluation  in the UN Secretariat III - Use Of Evaluation Data, Findings And Follow-Up IV - Roles And Responsibilities Of Secretariat Entities V - Evaluation Resources VI - Evaluation Support - DMSPC and OIOS VII - Annexes Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 01 In his report A/72/492 on ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United  Nations: ensuring a better future for all"", the Secretary-General committed to  strengthening the evaluation capacity of the UN Secretariat to better inform  programme planning and design and enhance reporting on programme  performance. A stronger evaluation function is integral to organizational  learning, improved accountability and increased transparency on programme  delivery to Member States. This new Administrative Instruction on Evaluation  in the UN Secretariat is intended to support and facilitate those critical goals.  The Administrative Instruction (AI):  *  establishes the Secretariat evaluation architecture;  *  sets out the Secretariat's requirements and procedures for the  management, conduct and use of evaluations;  *  details governance arrangements, accountabilities and performance  standards for Secretariat evaluation functions; *  outlines evaluation roles and responsibilities of Secretariat entities;  and   *  establishes the Evaluation Management Committee (a subcommittee  of the Management Committee chaired by the USG DMSPC) and the  Evaluation Advisory Committee (made up of an independent panel of  experts to advise OIOS on its evaluation function).  The current guidelines will therefore support entities to implement the new  AI and achieve the Secretary-General's vision of a ""culture of evaluation"" to  help guide our work. Annex 1 sets out the theory of change for strengthening  evaluation capacity within the Secretariat.  Evaluation in the UN Secretariat - What it is  and how it fits   In the UN Secretariat, evaluation is discussed in Article VII of the Regulations  and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the  Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation  (ST/SGB/2018/3), otherwise known as the PPBME. The new Administrative  Instruction builds upon the PPBME.  A New Administrative Instruction for  Evaluation in the UN Secretariat Antonio Guterres  Secretary-General Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 02 As per the PPBME, the objective of evaluation is:   *  (a) To determine as systematically and objectively as possible the  relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact of the Organization's  activities in relation to their objectives;  *  (b) To enable the Secretariat and Member States to engage in  systematic reflection, with a view to increasing the effectiveness of  the main programmes of the Organization by altering their content  and, if necessary, reviewing their objectives.   The definition of evaluation as agreed within the UN Evaluation Group is:   ""an assessment, conducted as systematically and impartially as possible,  of an activity, project, programme, strategy, policy, topic, theme, sector,  operational area or institutional performance... An evaluation should  provide credible, useful evidence-based information that enables the timely  incorporation of its findings, recommendations and lessons into the decision- making processes of organizations and stakeholders.  The purposes of  evaluation are to promote accountability and learning"". The PPBME mandates both ""external"" evaluation undertaken by the Office  of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), meaning external to the entity being  evaluated, and ""self-evaluation"" undertaken internally by an entity itself.   Following this framework, evaluation is undertaken in the UN Secretariat at  three different levels:  1.  Secretariat entities conduct their own evaluations with an internal  scope relating to their programmes, sub-programmes, functions,  activities and/or processes. The purpose of entity-led evaluations is  to facilitate internal assessment and reflection on how to enhance the  performance of the entity, to serve as a management tool and learning  function, and to support programme managers with identifying areas  for improvement.  2.  The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and its Inspection  and Evaluation Division (IED) conducts evaluations that are external  to the Secretariat entity being evaluated. The purpose of OIOS  evaluations is to provide an independent perspective on results  achieved and opportunities for greater achievement of programme  outcomes. OIOS evaluations have a dual learning and accountability  purpose, supporting Member States and senior leadership decision- making with independent and credible evaluative evidence. OIOS has  a reporting line directly to the Secretary-General, and to the General  Assembly, giving it independence from Secretariat entities.   We need a culture  of evaluation,  independent  and real-time  evaluation with  full transparency Antonio Guterres Secretary-General Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 03 3.  The System-wide evaluation unit in the Executive Office of the  Secretary-General (EOSG) and the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) conduct  UN system-wide evaluations. The purpose of these evaluations is to  provide UN system-wide assessments of cross-cutting issues and  topics of strategic importance for the United Nations organization.   Evaluation is part of a larger organizational architecture for assessing  programme performance which also includes the following processes:  *  Monitoring  *  Review  *  Audit  *  Inspection  *  Evaluation   Some definitions for other assessment processes include the following:   Monitoring: the periodic determination by the head of a department or office  of the actual delivery of final outputs in comparison with the commitments for  the delivery of outputs set out in the programme budget as approved by the  General Assembly.  Review: a periodic or ad hoc assessment that typically addresses  performance and operational issues of programme/project implementation.   Audit: an assessment of the adequacy of management controls with a primary  focus on compliance which looks at the effectiveness of governance, risk  management and control processes  . Inspection: an examination of an organizational unit, issue or practice  to determine the extent to which that unit, issue or practice adheres to  prescribed standards, good practices, or other criteria.   Evaluation: While sharing similarities with all the processes outlined above,  evaluation is distinct in that it is defined by all the following conditions:  *  is a systematic and discrete process, that determines the relevance,  efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and/or sustainability of any element  of a programme's performance relative to its mandate or goals;   *  can be performed at any level of a programme, such as an activity,  process, function, component, thematic area or subprogramme; *  provides credible, useful and evidence-based information thanks to  independence, impartiality and rigorous methodology  ;  Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 04 *  is a one-time event with a start and end date, and is usually presented  in the form of an evaluation report  ;  *  has a clearly defined design, including evaluation questions  ;  *  uses a well-defined methodology, ideally combining multiple methods,  to answer those questions; and  *  results in evidence-based evaluation findings and conclusions and  includes recommendations where applicable.  Evaluation provides an objective source of information to inform programme  planning, identify duplications and gaps in programme implementation, and  identify opportunities, such as organizational restructuring or work process  redesign, to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. It provides credible,  evidence-based information on results achieved by an entity or programme to  inform decision-making.  Within the Secretariat, evaluation serves three main purposes:  (a) Evidence-based decision-making:  Evaluation supports better decision-making. It should inform planning,  programming, budgeting, implementation and reporting and contribute to  evidence-based policymaking and organizational effectiveness. Evaluation  and feedback are critical to effective results-based management.1   (b) Learning:  A strong culture of evaluation is a prerequisite for a learning organization.  Evaluation helps the Secretariat to learn from experience and better  understand what works well, and not so well, in what contexts and why.  This learning can be the catalyst for innovation and continuous improvement.   (c) Accountability:  Evaluation is an integral part of the accountability framework and constitutes  an important source of evidence for understanding organizational  performance. The transparent reporting of evaluation results will enhance  Member States' confidence in the ability of the Secretariat to deliver on the  mandates entrusted to it.   The Norms and Standards for evaluation of the United Nations Evaluation  Group (UNEG) provide additional non-binding advice on the conduct and  management of evaluations2.  1 A/67/714 paragraph 91. 2 www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1914 Norms and Standards Evaluation  serves three  main purposes:  evidence-based  decision-making,  learning and  accountability Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 05 Drafting an evaluation policy The AI requires all Secretariat entities to have an evaluation policy. Those  entities that already have an existing evaluation policy should review and  update it as needed to adhere to and reference the requirements of the new  AI. Those entities that do not have an evaluation policy should develop one  based on the AI. The policy will contain more entity-specific information than  the AI since it will outline how evaluation will be planned, conducted and  used within the specific context of that entity's mandate, size, budget and  programme objectives.   An evaluation policy describes the principles and framework for an entity's  evaluation function. The policy need not be lengthy nor complex and should  emanate from the new AI. It is the important first foundational step to build an  evaluation function and culture in an entity.  An evaluation policy should contain the following elements:   *  A clear explanation of the concept and role of evaluation in the entity;  for example, if it is to be used for accountability, learning and/or  performance management purposes;  *  Reference to the UN Evaluation Group standards, such as utility,  credibility, independence, impartiality, and transparency;   *  A clearly defined institutional framework, with roles and  responsibilities spelled out;  *  How evaluation resources will be commensurate with the size and  function of the organization;   *  How often the policy will be reviewed and updated;  *  How evaluations are prioritized and planned;  *  How evaluations are organized, managed and budgeted;  *  Measures to ensure the quality of evaluations;  *  The mechanisms for the follow-up of evaluations, including how  evaluation results will feed into learning and planning;  *  Integration of gender, human rights and disability considerations in  evaluations; and  *  The disclosure and dissemination procedures for evaluations.  When developing an evaluation policy, the following good practices should be  considered:  *  The person/team tasked with drafting the evaluation policy should  include those who will manage and carry out evaluation activities;  *  The Head of the entity should be actively engaged and supportive of  the overall effort;  Evaluation Procedures Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 06 *  The drafting of the policy should be a consultative process;  *  The policy should be simple and clear so as to allow all programme  managers, staff and key stakeholders to understand it and appreciate  the benefits of evaluation;  *  The policy should be endorsed by the Head of the entity or governing  body; and  *  The policy should be periodically reviewed and, if needed, updated, to  ensure that it continues to meet the evaluation needs of the entity.    An evaluation policy template is provided in Annex 2. Evaluation planning and coverage norms The AI requires all entities to have an annual evaluation plan meeting specific  coverage criteria. Building an evaluation plan should ideally be a collaborative  process involving senior leadership and programme staff, which takes into  account management needs as determined by the entity's highest priority,  most relevant and/or most risky subprogrammes, issues and/or activities.  This could include, for example, considerations of budget, the strategic  importance of the subprogramme objectives and risk of non-performance,  or the need to assess a relatively new area of work for which an entity wants  to assess early performance and draw lessons learned.  Evaluation planning  should identify evaluations that will be useful for decision-making and senior  leadership information needs.  It is also considered best practice to submit  the evaluation plan to the Entity Head or Governing Body for review and  approval. Sample templates for an evaluation plan is provided in Annex 3a and  Annex 3b.   This plan can take the form of a timetable, report, or other format, but at a  minimum an evaluation plan should include:  *  At least one planned evaluation per year, with a clearly defined  purpose, scope and period covered;  *  The evaluation type(s), such as subprogramme, thematic, and/or  project evaluation;  *  Rationale for selecting the evaluation;   *  The anticipated application of evaluation(s) findings - how the results  will be used;   *  Who will conduct the evaluation, e.g. evaluation unit, consultant, or  external firm;  *  Who is responsible for managing the evaluation;  *  The budget or resources (staff) allocated for the evaluation; and  *  The timing of the evaluation (start date and estimated completion).  Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 07 The AI requires that entity evaluation plans cover each subprogramme at  least once every six years.  For larger entities, this could be a whole-of- subprogramme evaluation or an evaluation focused on a specific function,  activity, process and/or project in the subprogramme.  For peacekeeping  missions, this could be a whole-of-mission Results Based Budget mission  component evaluation or an evaluation focused on a specific function, activity,  process and/or project in the component.  For smaller entities with no specific  subprogrammes, this could be a whole-of-entity evaluation or an evaluation  focused on a specific function, activity, process and/or project in the entity.   All entities may also wish to consider cross-cutting thematic topics for  evaluation.   In order to ensure adequate evaluation coverage overall within the UN  Secretariat and also to avoid duplication, entities should coordinate their  evaluation plans with OIOS and with other external oversight bodies, such as  the JIU. To assist entities in this regard, DMSPC can provide (by request) the  evaluation plans from OIOS and JIU. Alternatively, these plans are available  online at the entities' websites. Management and conduct of evaluation  The AI requires management arrangements for evaluation be put in place to  ensure independence and impartiality.  The independence of the evaluation  function entails the ability of evaluators to evaluate without undue influence  by any party and ensures credibility of the evaluation results. The key  elements of impartiality include objectivity, professional integrity and absence  of bias, all of which should be present in all stages of the evaluation process.   Staff responsible for designing, managing and conducting evaluations should  conform to UN Evaluation Group ethical guidelines and ensure that evaluation  staff and consultants are aware of and follow those standards. The staff and  consultants should also be selected through an open, transparent process,  with balance in terms of geographical and gender diversity.  While ideally the evaluation function should be positioned independently from  other programmatic functions, when it is co-located with other management  functions, it is important that evaluators and evaluation managers are  not directly responsible for the policy setting, design or management of  the subprogramme/mission component/function/activity/function being  evaluated. It is also important that the evaluation function has a direct line  of communication (and ideally a direct reporting line) to the Entity Head or  Governing Body.  Finally, it is key that evaluators are provided with access to  the information they need to undertake the evaluation.   Evaluation is  an assessment,  conducted as  systematically  and impartially  as possible, of an  activity, project,  programme,  strategy, policy,  topic, theme, sector,  operational area  or institutional  performance  Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 08 The AI requires entities to develop an evaluation inception report or Terms of  Reference (TOR) for each evaluation it undertakes.  The TOR should be shared  with stakeholders, where possible, to promote transparency and engagement.  A sample TOR template is provided in Annex 4. An evaluation TOR should  ideally include the following elements:  *  Purpose of the evaluation  *  Evaluation scope  *  Objective(s) of evaluation  *  Evaluation questions, sub-questions and criteria  *  Methodology  *  Expected deliverable(s)  *  Evaluation process and timeline  *  Potential use of the evaluation  The AI additionally requires that evaluation results, lessons learned, and  recommendations be incorporated into planning and budget documents  as per the process, templates and guidance provided by OPPFB. BTAD's  Evaluation Section can advise on this. Quality Assurance  The AI requires entities to have an evaluation quality assurance system.  A quality assurance system is also called for in Standard 5.1 in the UN  Evaluation Group Norms and Standards for Evaluation. Producing high-quality  evaluations is key to improving performance, generating knowledge, and  supporting accountability and credibility of programmatic results. There are  many ways to introduce quality assurance processes in evaluations, such as  peer reviews, expert guidance and oversight, as well as quality check lists. For  nascent evaluation offices it is recommended to start with quality checklists,  which help evaluation managers take into consideration key quality attributes  of both the evaluation process and the evaluation report.  The following quality assessment framework can be considered when  establishing a quality assurance system for evaluation reports: Background: Are the evaluation's subject, context, purpose, objectives and  scope sufficiently clear to frame and guide the evaluation? 1. The report clearly specifies the subject of the evaluation, and for  programmes or projects: intervention logic or theory of change; budget;  human resources; time frame; implementing partners, modalities and status. Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 09 2. The report provides sufficient information for understanding the context  within which the subject of the evaluation operated (e.g. key social, political,  economic, demographic and institutional factors) and describes the key  stakeholders involved in the evaluation's subject. 3. The report clearly specifies the purpose and objectives of the evaluation. 4. The report specifies the scope of what the evaluation covers (e.g. time  span, geographical coverage).  Methodology: Is the methodology used for the evaluation clearly described  and is the rationale for the methodological choice justified? 5. The report specifies and explains the chosen evaluation questions,  criteria, performance standards or other criteria.  6. The methodology clearly describes the level of stakeholder participation,  data sources, and data collection and analysis methods.  7. The chosen methodology is adequately robust/appropriate for answering  the key evaluation questions, including adequate measures to ensure data  quality/validity.  8. The methodology addresses methodological challenges and/or  limitations, and the report mentions ethical standards that were considered  during the evaluation (e.g. informed consent of participants, confidentiality,  avoidance of harm, evaluator's ethical obligations). Findings: Are the findings clearly presented, relevant and based on evidence  and sound analysis? 9. Findings are presented with clarity, logic, and coherence (e.g. avoid  ambiguities). 10. Findings clearly relate to the evaluation criteria and questions defined in  the scope in terms of report structure and substance. 11. Findings are objective and are supported by sufficient evidence  reflecting systematic and appropriate analysis and interpretation of the data;  they are free from subjective judgements made by the evaluators. 12. Findings uncover underlying causes for accomplishments/difficulties  and opportunities to build on. Conclusions and lessons learned: Are the conclusions clearly presented  based on findings and substantiated by evidence? 13. Conclusions are clearly presented and logically linked to the findings. 14. Conclusions reflect reasonable judgments of the evaluator(s) in relation  to the main evaluation questions and add value to the findings (e.g. include  lessons learned, focus on significant issues, answer the evaluation's big  questions). Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 10 Recommendations (if any): Are the recommendations well-grounded in the  evaluation and clear? 15. Recommendations are logically derived from the findings and/or  conclusions. 16. Recommendations are clear, realistic (e.g. reflect an understanding of  the subject's potential constraints to follow-up) and manageable (e.g. avoid  providing a laundry list or being overly prescriptive). 17.Recommendations are actionable (e.g. specifies who should implement  them) and formulated with their use in mind.  Gender, human rights and disability: Are gender, human rights and disability  perspectives integrated and well addressed in the process of the evaluation  as well as in the evaluation report? 18. Gender equality and women's empowerment (GEWE) is integrated in  the evaluation scope of analysis and evaluation criteria and questions are  designed in a way that ensures GEWE related data will be collected. 19. A gender-responsive methodology, methods and tools, and data analysis  techniques are selected.  20. The evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations reflect a  gender analysis. 21. Human rights considerations are integrated in the following, where  applicable: evaluation scope of analysis, evaluation criteria and questions  design, methods and tools, and data analysis techniques, evaluation  findings, conclusions and recommendations.  Report structure: Is the report well structured, logical, clear and complete? 22. The executive summary is a stand-alone section with a clear structure  along the key elements of the report: subject, purpose and objectives of the  evaluation, methodology, main results, conclusions, and recommendations.  It is reasonably concise. 23. The report is well-structured:  *  easily readable (i.e. concise, avoids complex language and  unexplained acronyms);  *  cohesive and logical;  *  contains relevant graphics for illustrating key points (e.g. tables,  charts and pictures);  *  includes annexes where applicable on methodology such as the  Terms of Reference, evaluation matrix, bibliography, and a list of  people consulted; and  *  states when the evaluation was conducted (period of the evaluation)  and by whom the evaluation (evaluator names not required). Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 11 The AI requires Heads of Entities to promote the use of evaluation data,  findings, and follow-up through an interactive process. The UN Evaluation  Group stresses that proactive and effective communication and dissemination  contribute to the use of evaluation, not only for public accountability purposes  but also for knowledge building and sharing, cross-fertilization of lessons  learned and the promotion of good practices.  In this sense, evaluations  should be actively disseminated to all relevant stakeholders and to any  potential users of the information and knowledge generated.    Effective evaluation communication should be presented in simple and easily  understandable formats tailored to the specific needs of different audiences.  Evaluation results can also be disseminated through innovative ways,  e.g. social media, videos, dashboards and other type of data visualization  techniques.  Messages to communicate include:  *  Key findings and recommendations from evaluations;  *  Relevance and contribution of evaluations to the effectiveness of the  organization and its operations;  *  Successes and good practices identified by evaluations, including the  uptake of findings and recommendations for improvement;  *  The organization's evaluation experience and technical capability; and  *  Any outstanding evaluation innovations. In the interest of accountability, the UN Evaluation Group Norms and  Standards promote the transparency of evaluation reports. On this basis,  evaluation reports should be made publicly available. The overall approach  to classifying information entrusted to or originating from the United Nations  is based on the understanding that the work of the United Nations should be  open and transparent, except insofar as the nature of information concerned  is deemed confidential or sensitive3.  In those cases, the head of the entity can  determine that an evaluation report should not be made publicly available at  all, or only made available after necessary redaction.   Regardless of the decision on publication, each entity must share their annual  evaluation plan and all evaluation reports with BTAD's Evaluation Section and  OIOS IED using the contact details at the end of this document. Entities should  also note that plans to conduct evaluations and the key learning resulting  from completed evaluations should be included in the relevant budget and  programme documents as detailed in the programme planning and budget  instructions. These documents are publicly available.   Use of evaluation data, findings  and follow-up 3 Section 1.2 of ST/SGB/2007/6 (Information sensitivity, classification and handling) describes what kind of information can be deemed  sensitive Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 12 The AI also requires that entities prepare a management response to each  evaluation. The development of an evaluation management response  is a crucial step to improve the timely and effective use of evaluations  and to ensure that recommendations are implemented. Through the  management response process, evaluation stakeholders review the  evaluation recommendations and agree on the actions to be taken to  implement the recommendations, with specific accountability and timelines  for implementation. When recommendations are rejected, the management  response should provide detailed justification of the reasons for rejection.  As stated in the Instruction, all management responses shall be made  public, except when dealing with confidential information. Figure 1 shows  a suggested configuration of respective roles and responsibilities for an  evaluation management response.  It is also important to track the progress made in implementing  recommendations through a tracking system. This system can be as simple  as a table where the recommendations are assigned a responsible party  and a deadline for completion. Reporting on the follow-up to evaluation  recommendations should take place at regular intervals and should be aligned  with the organization's planning processes. Figure 1: Roles and responsibilities in the Evaluation Management Response Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 13 Integrating respect for gender equality, disability  and human rights   As determined in Norm 8 of the UN Evaluation Group Norms and Standards  for Evaluation, gender equality, disability and human rights-responsive  evaluation should be integrated throughout the different steps of the  evaluation process. Disability inclusion must also be considered.   This includes:   *  putting together evaluation teams that are diverse and gender  balanced;   *  mapping and consulting evaluation stakeholders with a view to  gender, disability and human rights considerations;   *  reflecting any relevant gender, disability and disability-specific aspects  of the programme;   *  ensuring an evaluation methodology and including evaluation  questions that focus on the aforementioned three dimensions;   *  collecting sex-disaggregated data; and   *  writing the evaluation report presenting relevant findings and  recommendations related to all three dimensions.  Roles and responsibilities  of Secretariat entities The AI further requires Heads of entities to ensure adequate capacity and  resources for evaluation capacity. As per standards established by the JIU (in  its report JIU/REP/2014/6, para 77), the general range of evaluation funding  should be between 0.5% and 3% of organizational expenditure, depending  on the mandate and size of the entity.  This need not require new resources  but could also be addressed through the reallocation of existing resources.   Entities are also encouraged to think about the possibility of pooling resources  with other entities with similar mandates and expanding upon already existing  review and assessment exercises.  Evaluation resources   Guidelines - Administrative Instruction on Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat 14 Both DMSPC and OIOS are available to provide support to Secretariat entities  with their evaluation function.  DMSPC is mandated by the General Assembly  to provide policy leadership in all management areas, including evaluation,  through a clear, integrated global management strategy and policy framework  and through strengthened monitoring, evaluation and accountability  mechanisms.  OIOS , as the Central Evaluation Unit discussed in the PPBME, is  responsible for quality standards, methodology and guidelines for the conduct  of evaluation, as well as providing methodological guidance to entities and for  the adaptation and transfer of evaluation information and knowledge.     The main support activities are identified in the table below.

The purpose of the present information circular is to inform all staff of the  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat,  which has been prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 69/249  and 70/255.  2.  The objective of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel 1 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption.  3.  Staff members at all levels are expected to become familiar with the contents  of the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework and to comply with the guidance  and principles established therein. They must also be aware that committing acts of  this nature will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal.  4.  The issuance of this policy will be accompanied by a communications  campaign Secretariat-wide to raise awareness about fraudulent acts and on how the  Secretariat's acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption, and to ensure that relevant risks are effectively mitigated.         __________________    * Information circulars will be subsequently issued to inform staff members of updates to the  Framework that might be introduced through changes in the Secretariat's regulations, rules,  administrative instructions and standard operating procedures.     1 Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than Secretariat officials and  experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants, interns, gratis personnel, participants in  advisory meetings, ""when actually employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  2/32    Annex       Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat         Summary    Combating fraud and corruption in the United Nations Secretariat is a primary  responsibility of staff, including management, and other United Nations Secretariat  personnel, and is a responsibility that the Secretariat also applies to its relationship  with third parties.     The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel and third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. This means that all allegations of fraudulent acts committed by  any individual or entity involved in a contractual relationship with the Organization  will be vigorously pursued.    ""Fraudulent acts"" include both ""fraud"" and ""corruption"". Fraud encompasses  any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or  conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself,  herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment.  Corruption encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks  to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for  oneself or a third party.    Fraudulent acts are considered misconduct. In the case of staff members, such  acts will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal. Other measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the  Organization and the referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to  national authorities, when appropriate. Other United Nations personnel may also be  the subject of sanctions for this type of misconduct as defined in the Framework.    Staff members -- and other United Nations personnel -- have the duty to  report any and all possible cases of fraudulent acts either to the Head of Office/  Mission or responsible officer, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management or the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). OIOS has a  dedicated hotline whereby cases may be reported in a confidential manner:  https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing.     The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of those reporting  alleged cases of fraudulent acts. It has in place a protection against retaliation policy  that applies to staff members, interns and United Nations Volunteers who have  reported misconduct. Other United Nations personnel should adhere to the provisions  of their respective contracts in this respect.    OIOS is the main entity typically responsible for conducting investigations of  high-risk cases involving complex matters and/or serious criminal cases, including  serious or complex fraud. Lower-risk cases are typically handled by programme  managers or other dedicated investigative bodies.    ST/IC/2016/25    3/32  16-15827      The Secretariat reports to Member States on all cases of fraud through reports  to the General Assembly and the Board of Auditors. In its reports, OIOS refers to  specific investigations of possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts. In addition,  the Secretariat reports on a yearly basis cases of misconduct and/or criminal  behaviour and the disciplinary consequences thereof, as well as cases involving  credible allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts  on mission that have been referred to their States of nationality.

The Charter of the United Nations states that the ""paramount consideration in  the employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service  shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity..."" (Article 101). The promotion and maintenance of a culture of  integrity and honesty is a basic requirement for combating fraud and corruption and  a primary responsibility of staff, including management, in the United Nations  Secretariat.  2.  The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel or third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. ""Zero tolerance"" means that the Secretariat will pursue all  allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by the  regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies, procedures and agreements  described in the Framework and that appropriate administrative/disciplinary  measures or contractual remedies will be applied if wrongdoing is established. In  addition, certain matters involving credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing may  be referred to national authorities when appropriate.        II. Purpose      3.  The purpose of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel2 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than  Secretariat officials and experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants,  interns, gratis personnel, participants in advisory meetings, ""when actually  employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers. The Framework describes the  Organization's existing regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and  procedures in these areas, including the roles and responsibilities of personnel and  the applicable sanctions.3 In addition, the Framework refers to third parties, who are  obliged to comply with all obligations related to fraudulent acts that are included in  their applicable agreements with the Secretariat.  4.  The Framework should be read in conjunction with the documents and  provisions referenced in annex I, ""Relevant sections of United Nations official  documentation related to fraudulent acts""; annex II, ""List of important treaties,  instruments, regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and manuals  governing fraudulent acts in the United Nations""; and annex III, ""Categories of  non-United Nations personnel not covered by the Framework"".      __________________    2 This category does not include: United Nations military experts on mission, including military  observers, military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent personnel.  Information related to these categories of non-United Nations personnel is included in annex III  to the Framework.    3 See, in particular, the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system  in the United Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    5/32  16-15827      III. Definitions      5.  For the purpose of the Framework, the term ""fraudulent acts"" in the United  Nations Secretariat is intended to include both ""fraud"", which encompasses any act  or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a  material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself,  itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment; and  ""corruption"", which encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority  or that seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue  benefit for oneself or a third party.   6.  Examples of fraudulent acts may include, but are not limited to, the following  acts, which are listed below for illustrative purposes:4    (a)  Submitting falsified documentation;    (b)  Improperly creating and using a document that purportedly authorizes a  staff member or a third party to remove property belonging to the Organization;    (c)  Misrepresenting educational qualifications;    (d)  Making material omissions or false inclusions in personal history profiles  (PHPs);    (e)  Knowingly submitting an education grant, a medical, travel or other  entitlement claim and documentation containing false information;    (f)  Knowingly  including  false  information  in  movement-related  documentation submitted to the Organization;    (g)  Declaring private telecommunications charges to be official;    (h)  Improperly assisting a person external to the Organization to secure  United Nations employment in exchange for money or other favours;     (i)  Improperly assisting a vendor in a procurement process;    (j)  Manipulating a procurement or recruitment process to ensure a certain  outcome;    (k)  Misusing United Nations resources to benefit oneself or a third party;     (l)  Soliciting or accepting bribes;     (m) Revealing internal confidential information in order to obtain a benefit  for oneself or a third party;    (n)  Participating in the recruitment process of a family member or a person  with respect to whom one has an undisclosed conflict of interest;     (o)  Participating in a procurement and/or contract management process  involving a person or entity with whom/which one has an undisclosed conflict of  interest;  __________________    4 Additional examples more specifically related to ""third parties"" are included in sect. X, para. 61,  below.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  6/32      (p)  Manipulating administrative processes to disburse payments to benefit  oneself or a third party, such as by creating fake contracts, fake third-party  beneficiaries or ghost employees;    (q)  Improperly altering the labelling on the salary envelopes of individual  contractors and removing cash from the envelopes, all without authorization;    (r)  Taking property of the United Nations Secretariat without authorization.   7.  Established ""fraudulent acts"" in the United Nations Secretariat are considered  to be ""misconduct"", and article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  ""Disciplinary measures"", and staff rules 10.1 and 10.2 clearly state the actions that  the Secretariat takes with regard to staff who engage in this type of behaviour. In  addition, sections IX and X below clearly define the actions that are taken in cases  involving other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third parties (including  implementing partners, vendors and non-State donors).        IV. Scope      8.  The Framework is applicable to fraudulent acts throughout the United Nations  Secretariat, which includes peacekeeping missions and special political missions.  The roles of particular actors within the Secretariat are summarized below:    (a)  The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer of the United  Nations, is ultimately accountable for the establishment and management of an  effective system for the prevention and detection of, as well as the enforcement of  measures against, fraudulent acts; response to allegations of fraudulent acts; and the  effectiveness of the system of related internal controls in this regard within the  United Nations;5     (b)  Heads of department/office and programme managers are accountable to  the Secretary-General and have the delegated responsibility for ensuring that the  existing internal control system, including all measures aimed at preventing and  detecting fraudulent acts, is functioning effectively; that all measures aimed at  preventing and detecting fraudulent acts are put in place; and that an appropriate  and robust internal control environment is maintained, including those components  related to integrity and ethical values, compliance requirements and disclosure. The  Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management is responsible for reviewing  and updating the Framework as required;     (c)  All staff members are expected to be aware that fraudulent acts, whatever  their extent and form, are contrary to the standards of conduct expected of  international civil servants and, if established, constitute misconduct, as provided  for in staff rule 10.1 of chapter X, ""Disciplinary measures"", of the Staff Regulations  and Rules, for which a staff member may be sanctioned and even dismissed (see  staff regulation 10.1 and staff rule 10.2). In addition, pursuant to staff rule 1.2 (c),  staff members have the duty to report cases of suspected misconduct, including  suspected fraudulent acts, to either a head of department/office, the Assistant  __________________    5 See Charter of the United Nations, Articles 97, 100 and 101; and the report of the Secretary- General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    7/32  16-15827    Secretary-General for Human Resources Management 6 or the Office of Internal  Oversight Services (OIOS);    (d)  Other categories of United Nations Secretariat personnel7 are governed  by the relevant applicable provisions, in particular consultants and individual  contractors,8 interns,9 United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the  United Nations Development Programme,10 officials other than Secretariat officials  and experts on mission, 11 gratis personnel, 12 participants in advisory meetings, 13  personnel on non-reimbursable loans from sources external to the United Nations  common system14 and ""when actually employed"" personnel;15    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the United  Nations Secretariat are: OIOS, the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and  the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. Those bodies have been established by  the General Assembly to assist in promoting a culture of compliance and integrity  and in deterring fraudulent acts by independently assessing the adequacy and  effectiveness of the internal control systems and, in the case of OIOS, undertaking  investigations into possible cases of fraudulent acts, as appropriate.        V. Prevention measures for fraudulent acts      9.  The Organization has established a comprehensive framework of measures to  prevent cases of fraudulent acts, as listed below.        A. Standards of conduct      10. All United Nations staff members must uphold the standards of conduct that  are prescribed, in particular in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations16 and Rules and the relevant administrative issuances as listed in annex  I to the Framework. Under Article 100 of the Charter, the staff ""shall not seek or  receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the  Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their  position as international officials responsible only to the Organization"".  __________________    6 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    7 See sect. IX below.    8 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    9 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    10 See Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers and the memorandum of  understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations  Volunteers.    11 See Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    12 See ST/AI/1999/6, on gratis personnel.    13 See ST/AI/2013/5, on participants in advisory meetings.    14 See ST/AI/231/Rev.1, on non-reimbursable loans of personnel services from sources external to  the United Nations common system.    15 See ST/SGB/283, on the use of ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives,  envoys and other special high-level positions"". See also sect. IX, para. 45, below.    16 ST/SGB/2016/5.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  8/32    11.  Under staff regulation 1.1, staff members must make a written declaration that  they will, inter alia, exercise ""in all loyalty, discretion and conscience"" the functions  entrusted to them as international civil servants of the United Nations, discharge  those functions and regulate their conduct ""with the interests of the United Nations  only in view"" and respect the obligations incumbent upon them as set out in the  Staff Regulations and Rules.   12. Under staff regulation 1.2, staff members must uphold the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity. It is specified that ""the concept of integrity  includes, but is not limited to, probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and  truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status"". Moreover, staff  regulation 1.2 (g) provides that staff members ""shall not use their office or  knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain, financial or  otherwise, or for the private gain of any third party, including family, friends and  those they favour. Nor shall staff members use their office for personal reasons to  prejudice the positions of those they do not favour"".  13. Standards of conduct are repeated and explained further in the Staff Rules 17  and in the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of  United Nations staff members.18 Staff shall also be guided by the International Civil  Service Commission Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service. 19  14. Similar high standards of conduct are required of other United Nations  personnel, as outlined in the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and  Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission 20 or in  the applicable administrative issuances (see para. 8 (d) above) and provisions  contained in their respective contracts.  15. Standards of conduct for other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third  parties are set forth in their respective contracts.         B. Protection against retaliation      16. The Secretary-General issued a specific administrative issuance prohibiting  retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits  or investigations.21 It sets forth protective measures for staff members, interns and  United Nations Volunteers under threat of, or experiencing, retaliation for duly  reporting misconduct or for cooperating with duly authorized audits or  investigations. The protective measures may include measures to safeguard the  interests of the complainant pending the completion of the investigation, such as  temporary suspension of the implementation of the action reported as retaliatory and  temporary reassignment of the complainant.22 If the Ethics Office finds that there is  a credible case of retaliation or threat of retaliation, it will refer the matter in  writing to OIOS for investigation and immediately notify the complainant in writing  __________________    17 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    18 ST/SGB/2016/9.    19 See http://icsc.un.org/resources/pdfs/general/standardsE.pdf.    20 ST/SGB/2002/9.    21 ST/SGB/2005/21.    22 Ibid., sect. 5.6.    ST/IC/2016/25    9/32  16-15827    of that referral. All complaints are handled according to specific procedures that  ensure confidentiality and prompt and proper attention.  17. Any retaliatory measures by a United Nations staff member against a  contractor or his or her employees, agents or representatives, or any other individual  dealing with the United Nations, as a result of that person's reporting misconduct by  a United Nations staff member will likewise be considered misconduct that, if  established, will lead to disciplinary or other appropriate action.  18. The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of the individual's  identity and all communications related to misconduct that have been made through  the channels established in paragraph 16 above to the maximum extent possible. 23        C. Risk management      19. Enterprise risk management is a comprehensive process designed to identify,  assess and respond to risks, including fraudulent acts, that could affect the ability of  the Secretariat to effectively achieve its mandates and objectives.  20. While the ultimate responsibility for effective risk and internal control  management within the Secretariat resides with the Secretary-General, every  manager in the Secretariat is responsible for identifying and mitigating the risks that  might affect the operations under his or her responsibility. Systematic fraud risk  assessments should be undertaken in accordance with the Secretariat's enterprise  risk management and internal control policy and methodology. 24 Such analysis  should include known fraud risk factors, potential fraud schemes, control gaps, red  flag identification and mapping. Technical advice on the implementation of  enterprise risk management is available from the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management.         D. Internal control system      21. The United Nations internal control system25 is composed of regulations, rules,  administrative issuances, policies, processes and procedures of the Secretariat,  which staff members are obliged to respect, and is designed to provide assurance  regarding the achievement of organizational objectives, adequate resource  utilization, reliable financial reporting and compliance with relevant regulations,  rules and policies, including preventing and detecting fraudulent acts. The system  includes, but is not limited to:    (a)  The regulations, rules and administrative issuances of the Secretariat,  which include:  __________________    23 Ibid., sect. 3. The established internal mechanisms for reporting misconduct are OIOS, the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, the head of the department or  office concerned or the focal point appointed to receive reports of sexual exploitation and abuse.    24 The enterprise risk management policy is set out in the report of the Secretary-General on  progress towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/66/692), and  information on the enterprise risk management methodology is available on iSeek.    25 See the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640) and General Assembly resolution 64/259.

ST/IC/2016/25    11/32  16-15827      (ii) The systems for delegation of authority and segregation of duties  (covering finance, human resources, procurement and information technology)  aimed at strengthening internal controls by ensuring that a single individual  does not control all phases of a decision or transaction involving the resources  of the Organization;     (d)  The internal justice system, which seeks to assist in efforts to enhance  accountability and consists of two pillars of dispute settlement mechanisms,  informal and formal: the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation  Services,37 which is central to the informal system, and the Management Evaluation  Unit38 and the system of administration of justice, which are essential parts of the  formal system. The latter comprises two levels of independent judicial review: the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal. Relevant  legislation includes the statutes and rules of both Tribunals;39    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the Secretariat  are described in section IV, paragraph 8 (e), above. Of these four, OIOS is the main  internal body that conducts investigations in the Secretariat. OIOS has established a  mechanism to enable allegations to be reported directly to it at https://oios.un.org/  page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing. OIOS is typically responsible for investigating  serious misconduct, including serious or complex fraudulent acts.40        E. Fraud and corruption awareness programme      22. To ensure that the risk of fraud and corruption is effectively mitigated, the  Secretariat implements a communications campaign to raise awareness about  fraudulent acts and their prevention. The Ethics Office promotes an anti-fraud/  anti-corruption culture by fostering an organizational culture of integrity,  transparency and accountability, providing confidential ethics advice to all staff,  including managers, on appropriate standards of conduct and including fraud and  corruption awareness components in its ethics training programmes.  23. In addition, the United Nations intranet site provides information related to the  prevention of fraudulent acts, including common or frequently asked questions and  answers, hotlines, training materials and relevant documentation such as the  Organization's administrative instructions and Secretary-General's bulletins. All  staff members are encouraged to visit the intranet site and familiarize themselves  with its contents.   24. All staff members are expected to complete the mandatory online anti-fraud  training when it is available.     __________________    37 See ST/SGB/2016/7, on terms of reference for the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and  Mediation Services.    38 The Management Evaluation Unit is within the Department of Management and evaluates  managerial decision-making to ensure that it is in accordance with the relevant regulations, rules  and administrative issuances and identifies emerging trends and systemic problems so that  management can take swift corrective action.    39 See General Assembly resolution 62/228; ST/SGB/2010/3, on the organization and terms of  reference of the Office of Administration of Justice; and ST/SGB/2010/9, on the organization of  the Department of Management (sect. 10).    40 See General Assembly resolution 59/287.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  12/32      F. Prevention of conflicts of interest      25. As stated in staff regulation 1.2 (m), a conflict of interest occurs when a staff  member's personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official  duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality  required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an  actual or possible conflict of interest does arise (see examples set out in sect. III,  paras. 6 (o) and (p), above), the conflict shall in the first instance be disclosed by  the staff member to his or her head of office, mitigated by the Organization and  resolved in favour of the interests of the Organization.  26. Staff regulation 1.2 (n) further establishes that all staff members at the  D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial disclosure statements 41 on  appointment and at intervals thereafter as prescribed by the Secretary-General, in  respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent children, and to assist the  Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the information submitted when so  requested. The same obligation to file financial disclosure statements is imposed on  certain categories of other staff, including those designated by their heads of  department/office by a subsequent administrative issuance. 42        VI. Reporting fraudulent acts      27. Staff rule 1.2 (c)43 states:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action...""  28. Fraudulent acts constitute a violation of the Staff Regulations and Rules and  relevant administrative issuances and, as a result, under staff rule 1.2 (c), any staff  member with information regarding possible wrongdoing in this regard that involves  United Nations property, assets, personnel or third parties is obliged to report the  matter either to the head of office/mission or the responsible officer, 44 the Assistant  __________________    41 The purpose of the United Nations Secretariat's financial disclosure programme, as administered  by the Ethics Office, is to protect the integrity and reputation of the Organization by ensuring  that potential conflicts of interest arising from the financial holdings, private affiliations or  outside activities of staff members can be identified and properly managed.    42 ST/SGB/2006/6 imposes this duty on staff at the D-1 or L-6 level and above, all staff of the  Ethics Office and other staff designated by their heads of department/office (including staff  whose principal duties involve procurement or investment of assets and other staff with direct  access to confidential procurement or investment information (sect. 2.1 (b), (c) and (d)) and  describes how the Organization may proceed against any staff member who fails to comply with  the filing of obligations under the disclosure programme.    43 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    44 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. In the case of  peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the commanding  officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for onward  transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline Team or  the conduct and discipline focal point. The focal points on sexual exploitation and abuse are also  authorized to receive reports of cases of this nature.

OIOS can provide  advice on potential fraudulent acts and receive reports in a confidential manner  through the dedicated hotline, accessible at https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting- wrongdoing.  29. As noted above, the Secretariat has an established protection against  retaliation policy applicable to staff members, interns and United Nations  Volunteers who allege that they have been subjected to retaliation or the threat of  retaliation as a consequence of reporting misconduct or cooperating with a duly  authorized audit or investigation.46 Other United Nations personnel should adhere to  the provisions of their respective contracts in this regard.  30. United Nations military experts on mission, including military observers,  military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent  personnel, information about whom is included in annex III to the Framework, are  not considered United Nations personnel. They are subject to the investigation and  disciplinary authorities and procedures of the contributing Member State.  Nonetheless, any staff member with information regarding any possible misconduct  involving this category of non-United Nations personnel is obliged to report the  matter to either the head of office/mission or a responsible officer,47 the Conduct  and Discipline Team 48 or OIOS.49 The United Nations, for its part, is obliged to  report, without delay, alleged misconduct, including fraudulent acts, by national  contingent members to their respective Governments.         VII. Investigations of allegations involving United Nations staff      31. Staff rule 1.2 (c), ""Basic rights and obligations of staff"", establishes that:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action and to cooperate with duly authorized audits and  investigations. Staff members shall not be retaliated against for complying  with these duties.""  32. All allegations of misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- are reviewed and  investigated, as appropriate, by the Secretariat. As stated in the administrative  __________________    45 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    46 See ST/SGB/2005/21. Protection against retaliation requests are to be filed with the Ethics  Office. If the Ethics Office determines a prima facie case of retaliation, it will refer the matter to  OIOS for investigation. The policy provides for interim and final retaliation protection measures,  and further prohibits retaliation against contractors or other third parties that report misconduct  by United Nations staff members (further information about the policy may be found in annex II  to the Framework).    47 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures.    48 In the case of peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the  commanding officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for  onward transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline  Team or the conduct and discipline focal point.    49 See revised draft model memorandum of understanding (A/61/19 (Part III), annex).  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  14/32    instruction on revised disciplinary measures and procedures (ST/AI/371 and  Amend.1),50 heads of office/mission or responsible officers are obliged to undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in  possible misconduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed.   33. OIOS will typically conduct all investigations considered to be high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including serious or complex fraudulent  acts.51        VIII. Actions based on investigations of allegations involving  United Nations staff      34. The Secretariat takes appropriate action (disciplinary/administrative and/or  referral to national authorities) against staff members on the basis of the results of  investigations into alleged misconduct.  35. Article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, ""Disciplinary measures"",  states, in regulation 10.1 (a), the following: ""The Secretary-General may impose  disciplinary measures on staff members who engage in misconduct"".  36. Staff rule 10.1 (a), ""Misconduct"", states that: ""Failure by a staff member to  comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances or to observe  the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant may amount to  misconduct and may lead to the institution of a disciplinary process and the  imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct.""  37. Financial rule 101.2 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations provides that ""[a]ll United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the  Financial Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who contravenes  the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding administrative instructions  may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions.""  38. Possible disciplinary measures range from written censure to dismissal. Other  measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the Organization and the  __________________    50 Currently under revision.    51 See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud. Such  cases can be handled by programme managers. If, however, there is an indication that the case  might involve possible illegal activity and the use of trained professional investigators is  considered essential, then the case should be handled by OIOS. Where programme managers are  entrusted with conducting investigations, the results of their investigations should be reported to  OIOS (see General Assembly resolution 59/287). ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including the following: serious or complex fraud,  other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross  mismanagement, waste of substantial resources, cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to  others, and substantial violation of United Nations regulations, rules or administrative issuances.  Such cases should be brought to the attention of, and investigated by, OIOS.    ST/IC/2016/25    15/32  16-15827    referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to national authorities, when  appropriate.   39. In addition, in General Assembly resolution 62/63, on criminal accountability  of United Nations officials and experts on mission, as well as subsequent  resolutions on the same topic, the Assembly requested that, where credible  allegations reveal that a crime may have been committed by United Nations officials  or experts on mission, they be brought by the Secretary-General to the attention of  the States against whose nationals such allegations are made. In addition, those  States should provide an indication of the status of their efforts to investigate and,  as appropriate, prosecute crimes of a serious nature, as well as the types of  appropriate assistance States may wish to receive from the Secretariat for the  purposes of such investigations and prosecutions.  40. In accordance with article 45 bis of the Regulations, Rules and Pension  Adjustment System of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, in cases where a  Pension Fund participant is the subject of a criminal conviction by a competent  national court for fraud against the United Nations, the Fund may, at the request of a  United Nations member organization, remit to the relevant United Nations member  organization a portion of the pension benefit payable to the participant.        IX. Investigation of allegations involving other United Nations  Secretariat personnel      41. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel are governed by the respective  applicable administrative issuances, in particular officials other than Secretariat  officials and experts on mission,52 consultants and individual contractors, 53 interns54  and United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the United Nations  Development Programme.  42. Cases of possible misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- involving these  categories of personnel should be reported to either the head of office/mission 55/  responsible official, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management56 or OIOS and should be investigated as appropriate, in accordance  with applicable procedures.  43. In the case of officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission,  their status, basic rights and duties are established in the Regulations Governing the  Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and  Experts on Mission. 57  The Regulations establish, among other principles, their  standards of conduct and to whom they are accountable. Such officials may also be  subject to applicable provisions established in their respective contracts.  __________________    52 Experts on mission include, e.g., United Nations police officers, members of formed police units,  corrections officers and military observers; see Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights  and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    53 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    54 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    55 Cases involving missions can also be reported to the Conduct and Discipline Team.    56 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    57 ST/SGB/2002/9.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  16/32    44. In addition, the obligations described in section VIII, paragraph 39, above in  relation to General Assembly resolution 62/63 apply to United Nations experts on  mission.   45. Special representatives, envoys and other special high-level positions may be  contracted by the Organization on short-term appointments or other types of  contracts 58 and on a ""when actually employed"" basis. In the case of short-term  appointments, the oath of office shall be attached to the letter of appointment for  signature by the holder. The oath of office states that, as a staff member, he or she is  subject to the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations during the days of  his or her service, with all the rights, obligations and accountability measures that  that entails. In the case of other types of contracts, the conditions of service are  stated in paragraph 46 below.  46. Other personnel can be contracted with special service agreements, as well as  on a ""when actually employed"" basis. Their conditions of service are set out in the  contract document and the provisions of the administrative instruction on  consultants and individual contractors.59 In addition, if the individual concerned also  has the status of expert on mission, he or she will also be subject to the Regulations  Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission.   47. Finally, the provisions of the Secretary-General's bulletin governing the use of  ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives, envoys and other  special high-level positions 60 apply to short-term appointments or other types of  contracts as applicable.  48.  With respect to consultants and individual contractors, their duties, obligations  and systems of sanctions are defined in the administrative instruction governing the  contracting of consultants and individual contractors in the United Nations  Secretariat61 and in the general conditions of contracts for the services of consultants  and individual contractors that apply to this category of personnel and that are  incorporated into their individual contracts.   49. In the case of gratis personnel,62 the standards of conduct and accountability  measures to which they are subject are established in sections 11 and 12 of the  administrative instruction governing their relationship with the Secretariat.63  50. In the case of participants in advisory meetings, their terms and conditions are  set out in section 2 of the administrative instruction governing the relationship of  the Secretariat with this type of other United Nations personnel.64  __________________    58 Contract for the services of a consultant or individual contractor.    59 ST/AI/2013/4.    60 ST/SGB/283.    61 ST/AI/2013/4.    62 ""Gratis personnel"" refers to personnel who are provided to the United Nations by a Government  or other entity responsible for the remuneration of the services of such personnel and who do not  serve under any other established regime such as that applicable to interns, associate experts,  personnel provided on a non-reimbursable loan under the provisions of ST/AI/231/Rev.1 and  personnel provided to the United Nations Special Commission under the regime reported by the  Secretary-General to the Security Council in document S/22508 of 18 April 1991 (see  ST/AI/1999/6).    63 ST/AI/1999/6.    ST/IC/2016/25    17/32  16-15827    51. In the case of United Nations Volunteers, the basic terms of their conditions of  service, as well as their duties and obligations, including those related to  misconduct and disciplinary procedures, are established in the document entitled  ""Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers"" and the  memorandum of understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations and the United Nations Volunteers.  52.  In the case of interns, their responsibilities, obligations and systems of sanctions  are established in the administrative instruction establishing the conditions and  procedures for the selection and engagement of interns at the United Nations,65 as well  as in the internship agreement governing their contractual relationship with the United  Nations.  53. All of these categories of other United Nations Secretariat personnel are  required to cooperate fully with OIOS or other mandated investigations.        X. Third parties (including vendors, non-State donors and  implementing partners)      54. The Secretariat recognizes that, generally, to legally bind a third party to  comply with certain obligations, such obligations need to be included in a  contractually binding document between the United Nations and that third party. In  this connection, in the case of vendors, the United Nations General Conditions of  Contract, which are to be included as part of all procurement contracts for goods  and/or services entered into by the Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter  and address fraudulent acts. For example, the ""Observance of the Law"" clause  requires contractors to comply with all relevant laws regarding their performance of  the contract, and includes an express provision requiring contractors to maintain  compliance with all obligations relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of  goods or services to the United Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor  registration procedures; the ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to  warrant that they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative,  official, employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract  with the United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose  intended to gain an advantage for the contractor; the ""Audits and Investigations""  clause includes an obligation on the part of contractors to cooperate with  investigations/audits; and the ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a  requirement that contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high  standard of moral and ethical conduct.  55. The United Nations awards contracts to vendors registered with the  Secretariat. Vendors seeking to register with the Secretariat must, as part of the  vendor registration process, declare that they meet certain prerequisites. In addition,  vendors are informed that non-adherence to the principles set forth in the United  Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, which, inter alia, describes the Organization's  anti-corruption policies, will be a factor in considering their eligibility to be  registered as a United Nations supplier or to do business with the United Nations.   __________________    64 ST/AI/2013/5.    65 ST/AI/2014/1.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  18/32    56. Chapter 4 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Ethical Standards in  Procurement"", describes the ethical standards and responsibilities expected in  United Nations procurement and includes information regarding corrupt, fraudulent  and unethical practices (chap. 4.10).  57. Chapter 7 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Vendor Registration  and Management"", describes the Vendor Review Committee, which is an internal  review body that reviews and renders advice to the Assistant Secretary-General for  Central Support Services on vendor registration status, including the suspension or  removal of vendors from the ""Register of Vendors"". Upon receipt of  recommendations from the Vendor Review Committee, the Assistant Secretary- General for Central Support Services decides on any changes to a vendor 's  registration status, including suspension or removal from the ""Register of Vendors"".  Vendors are notified of such a decision and are informed that they may request its  review.   58. In the case of non-State donors and implementing partners, the Secretariat's  departments and offices should ensure that adequate due diligence is carried out  prior to engaging in a contractual relationship with them. They are expected to use  resources efficiently and for the intended purpose, and to refrain from, prevent and  mitigate all possible fraudulent acts.   59.  Non-State donors66 and implementing partners must ensure that proper procedures  are in place to address incidents of fraudulent acts. Non-State donors and implementing  partners are also expected to disclose to the Organization any potential conflict of  interest, and also to disclose if any official or professional under contract with the  United Nations may have an interest in or a financial tie to the non-State donor  organization or implementing partner's business.   60. All agreements with implementing partners should contain appropriate  anti-fraud and corruption clauses and clauses stating that they are subject to regular  monitoring activities, verifications and external (including forensic) audits for their  use of United Nations funds and sanctions in the case of proven allegations of fraud.  61. Examples of fraudulent acts by vendors, non-State donors and implementing  partners may include: the forging of documents; making false statements to obtain a  financial or other benefit to which the entity is not entitled; offering something of  value to improperly influence a procurement process; ""collusion"" or other  anti-competitive scheme between suppliers during a tender process to obtain undue  benefits; deliberate substandard compliance with contractual terms; diversion or  misappropriation of funds; purported delivery of diverted goods; billing twice or  multiple times for the same items or services; falsifying internal records that are  used to support claims; failing to report known overpayments and credit balances by  or to the Organization, ""extortion"" or ""coercion"" (the act of attempting to influence  the process of procuring goods, services or works, or executing contracts by means  of threats of injury to person, property or reputation); and so forth.      __________________    66 The term ""non-State donors"" refers to individuals, trusts and foundations, and companies.    ST/IC/2016/25    19/32  16-15827      XI. Reporting to Member States      62. The annex to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations  (ST/SGB/2013/4), entitled ""Additional terms of reference governing the audit of the  United Nations"", entrusts to the Board of Auditors the responsibility of reporting to  the General Assembly all cases of fraud or presumptive fraud in the context of its  reports to the intergovernmental bodies.   63. OIOS also submits annual reports to the General Assembly on its activities in  peacekeeping and regular budget areas, with references to specific investigations of  possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts.  64. In addition, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/63, on  criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission, and  subsequent resolutions on the same topic, the Secretary-General reports to the  Assembly on an annual basis the number and nature of cases involving credible  allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts on  mission, which have been referred to the States of nationality. In accordance with  Assembly resolution 70/114, the Secretary-General's reports also include  information on the United Nations entity involved; the type of crime and summary  of allegations; and the status of any investigation, prosecutorial and/or disciplinary  action taken by national authorities.   65. Finally, cases of misconduct and/or criminal behaviour involving Secretariat  staff members, and the disciplinary consequences thereof, are made public by the  Secretariat on a yearly basis in accordance with General Assembly resolution  59/287, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that all  staff of the Organization are informed of the most common examples of misconduct  and/or criminal behaviour and their disciplinary consequences, including any legal  action, with due regard for the protection of the privacy of the staff member(s)  concerned.        ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  20/32    Annex I    Relevant sections of United Nations official documentation  related to fraudulent acts        A. The Charter of the United Nations      1.  The Charter of the United Nations is the foundational treaty of the  Organization. It establishes, inter alia, that in the performance of their duties, ""the  Secretary-General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any  government or from any other authority external to the Organization"", and also  states that they shall ""refrain from any action which might reflect on their position  as international officials responsible only to the Organization"" (Article 100).  Furthermore, the Charter states that the ""paramount consideration in the  employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service shall  be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity"" (Article 101).        B. Oath of office      2.  Every United Nations staff member is called upon by the Charter of the United  Nations to uphold the highest levels of efficiency, competence and integrity. This  commitment is reflected in the United Nations oath of office, which every staff  member must take when he or she begins his or her career in the Organization and  which reads as follows:  ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government  or other source external to the Organization.  ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent  upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""        C. Outside activities      3.  Staff regulation 1.2 (o) establishes that staff members ""shall not engage in any  outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the  approval of the Secretary-General"". Staff rule 1.2 (s) to (v) further establishes  policies with regard to which outside activities may be performed by a staff member  and under what circumstances. Further elaboration on the internal procedures to  follow in regard to these provisions may be found in the administrative instruction  on outside activities (ST/AI/2000/13).        ST/IC/2016/25    21/32  16-15827      D. Gifts and hospitality      4.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) and (k) establishes that staff members shall not accept  any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any Government, except in  very limited circumstances under which a staff member may receive these on behalf  of the Organization. Staff regulation 1.2 (l) establishes that staff members shall not  accept  any  honour,  decoration,  favour,  gift  or  remuneration  from  any  non-governmental source without the prior authorization of the Secretary-General.  The administrative instruction on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours,  decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and non-governmental  sources (ST/AI/2010/1) provides further elaboration on the processes to follow.  Different provisions apply to staff members involved in the procurement process (see  sect. 4.8 of the United Nations Procurement Manual for guidance).         E. Use of the United Nations emblem      5.  The use of the United Nations emblem and name, including any abbreviation  thereof, is reserved for the official purposes of the United Nations, in accordance  with General Assembly resolution 92 (I) of 7 December 1946. That resolution  expressly prohibits the use of the United Nations name and emblem in any other  way without the express authorization of the Secretary-General, and recommends  that Member States take the measures necessary to prevent the use of the United  Nations emblem and name without the authorization of the Secretary-General.  Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (the  ""Convention""), revised in Stockholm in 1967, provides trademark protection in  respect of the emblems and names of ""international organizations"" and requires  States parties to the Convention ""to prohibit by appropriate measures the use,  without authorization by the competent authorities"", of the emblems and names of  international organizations. Pursuant to resolution 92 (I), some Member States have  promulgated legislation protecting the United Nations name and emblem, including  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of  America. If any entity other than the United Nations, its funds and programmes and  other subsidiary organs wishes to use the United Nations emblem and name, it is  required to seek prior authorization from the Office of Legal Affairs.        F. Use of property and assets      6.  Staff regulation 1.2 (q) establishes that United Nations assets and property  shall be used only for official purposes and with reasonable care. Moreover,  financial rule 106.7 (a) and (b) authorizes the Under-Secretary-General for  Management to request any staff member to reimburse the United Nations, either  partially or in full, for the loss of assets, including cash, receivables, property, plant  and equipment, inventories and intangible assets, if the staff member is responsible  for such loss.  7.  Further elaboration on the internal procedures related to property and assets of  the Organization may be found in the administrative instructions on the management  of property (ST/AI/2015/4) and on the control of United Nations property covered  by personal property receipts (ST/AI/97/Rev.2).     ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  22/32      G. Financial responsibility of staff members for gross negligence      8.  Staff rule 1.7, ""Financial responsibility"", requests staff members to ""exercise  reasonable care in any matter affecting the financial interests of the Organization, its  physical and human resources, property and assets"". In addition, staff rule 10.1 (b),  ""Misconduct"", establishes that where the staff member's failure to comply with his  or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an  international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute  misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the Organization, in  full or in part, for any financial loss suffered as a result of the staff member's  actions, if such actions are determined to be wilful, reckless or grossly negligent.  Under financial rule 101.2, ""Responsibility and accountability"", any staff member  ""who contravenes the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions"".        H. Relevant provisions of the United Nations General Conditions   of Contract      9.  The United Nations General Conditions of Contract, which are to be included  as part of all procurement contracts for goods and/or services entered into by the  Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter fraud, as follows:    (a)  The ""Observance of the Law"" clause requires contractors to comply with  all relevant laws regarding their performance of the contract, and includes an  express provision requiring contractors to maintain compliance with all obligations  relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of goods or services to the United  Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor registration procedures;     (b)  The ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to warrant that  they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative, official,  employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract with the  United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose intended to  gain an advantage for the contractor;     (c)  The ""Audits and Investigations"" clause includes an obligation on the part  of contractors to cooperate with investigations/audits;     (d)  The ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a requirement that  contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high standard of moral  and ethical conduct.        I. Post-employment restrictions      10. The  Secretary-General's  bulletin  on  post-employment  restrictions  (ST/SGB/2006/15) establishes the following restrictions on the post-employment  activities of staff members involved in procurement and the sanctions for violations  of those restrictions:    (a)  For a period of one year following separation from service, former staff  members may not seek or accept employment with, or accept any form of    ST/IC/2016/25    23/32  16-15827    compensation or financial benefit from, any vendor which conducts or seeks to  conduct business with the United Nations and with whom such staff members have  been personally involved in the procurement process during the last three years of  service with the Organization;    (b)  For a period of two years following separation from service, staff  members may not knowingly communicate with, or appear before, any staff member  or unit of the Organization on behalf of any third party on any matters that were  under their official responsibility relating to the procurement process during the last  three years of their service with the Organization;     (c)  While in service, staff members may not solicit or accept, directly or  indirectly, any promise or offer of future employment from any vendor which  conducts, or seeks to conduct, business with the Organization and with whom such  staff members have been personally involved in the procurement process during the  previous three years of service with the Organization.        J. Entities conducting investigations in the United Nations Secretariat      11.  The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established to assist the  Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight responsibilities, in particular  with regard to investigation, inspection and evaluation, monitoring and internal  audit.a It is the primary office charged with investigating high-risk, complex matters  and serious criminal cases -- including complex fraud and corruption cases --  which it has classified as ""category I"" cases. In respect of cases considered to be of  lower risk to the Organization -- classified by OIOS as ""category II"" casesb -- a  number of entities in the Secretariat may conduct investigations and/or  administrative inquiries, as described below:    (a)  Heads of department/office/mission and programme managers: heads of  department or responsible officers shall undertake investigations where there is  reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in unsatisfactory conduct for  which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;c    (b)  Department of Safety and Security: the investigative capability of the  Department of Safety and Security rests within the special investigation units at, for  example, Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions,  which also investigate category II cases;  __________________    a See General Assembly resolution 48/218 B.    b See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud.  ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases,  including the following: serious or complex fraud, other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of  authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross mismanagement, waste of substantial resources,  cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to others, substantial violation of United Nations  regulations, rules or administrative issuances, and complex proactive investigations aimed at  studying and reducing risk to life and/or United Nations property.    c See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. See also General  Assembly resolution 59/287, para. 7.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  24/32      (c)  Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field  Support:d    (i)  Panels convened by heads of mission: heads of mission can undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged  in unsatisfactory conduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;e    (ii) Special investigation units of the security sections of field missions are  mandated to investigate all category II cases -- and other, similar  allegations -- occurring in the missions or referred to missions by OIOS for  investigation. Field mission special investigation units can investigate  allegations against all personnel of a mission, but they conduct predominantly  investigations involving civilian personnel, i.e., staff members, United Nations  Volunteers, consultants, independent contractors and employees of United  Nations contractors.        K. Other review mechanism      12. In addition, the Ethics Office conducts ""preliminary reviews"" of retaliation  complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a  ""preliminary review"" is not considered to be an investigation. However, if the  Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to  OIOS for a complete investigation.f        __________________    d This section does not include areas of the Organization that cover military and police serving in  peacekeeping operations and special political missions, such as: the United Nations military  police (force provost marshal), who usually conduct investigations of possible misconduct by  military personnel (members of contingents, staff officers and United Nations military observers)  in instances where Member States do not exercise their primary jurisdiction to conduct such  investigations or in support of Member State investigations or the United Nations police, who  may investigate breaches of conduct and allegations involving United Nations police personnel  (formed police units and individually deployed United Nations police personnel). Finally, field  mission special investigation units can investigate allegations against all personnel of a mission,  but they predominantly conduct investigations involving civilian personnel.     e See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures.

The Secretary-General hereby  establishes the framework for the reissuance of new delegations of authority directly  to heads of entity1 to implement specified aspects of the Staff Regulations and Rules  and the Financial Regulations and Rules.   1.2 All delegations of authority, including any limitations, will be issued and  managed through an online portal, described below.   1.3 The matters reserved exclusively for the decision of the Secretary-General are  set out in the annexes to the present bulletin. Where authority over a matter is not  delegated, the matter is reserved for the decision of the Secretary-General.        Section 2      General principles of delegation (including subdelegation) of authority in the  administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  Regulations and Rules    2.1 As the chief administrative officer of the Organization under the Charter of the  United Nations, the Secretary-General holds the primary authority and accountability  for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  __________________    1  ""Head of entity"" means the head of a department or an office, including an office away from  Headquarters; the head of a special political or peacekeeping mission; the head of a regional  commission; a resident or regional coordinator; or the head of any other unit tasked with  programmed activities.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  2/23    Regulations and Rules. The Secretary-General's authority may be delegated in  accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the present bulletin.  2.2 The annexes to the present bulletin set out the standard authorities that a head  of entity may receive, depending on the capacity of the entity to receive and  implement the delegations in a responsible and effective manner. The capacity of any  entity may change over time, and the assessment of that capacity and the appropriate  level of specific delegations of authority shall be the responsibility of the Under- Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation  with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support and the head of entity  concerned.  2.3 A core principle of delegation of authority is the delegation of centrally held  decision-making closer to the point of service delivery. The exercise of a delegated  authority is the taking of a decision within the authority delegated and is separate  from the execution of that decision, which may require a specific administrative  capacity. Delegation of authority should not lead to the creation of new duplicative  administrative capacities in entities which lack the structural capacity to execute  decisions. Consequently, where the head of entity has the capacity to take a decision  under delegated authority but the entity lacks the appropriate capacity to execute the  decision, another entity will be assigned by the Under-Secretary-General for  Operational Support, in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the head of entity concerned, to  execute the decision on the entity's behalf as a service provider.  2.4 Where the Secretary-General has delegated the authority to administer the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules to heads of entity,  such delegation shall be understood to be on a functional, rather than personal, basis  unless the Secretary-General has expressly indicated otherwise.   2.5 All delegations of authority shall be made formally through the dedicated online  portal.2   The authorities delegated shall be clearly stated and accepted by both the  delegator and the delegatee, including that such delegation may be suspended,  amended or revoked as provided in section 4.4 below. The delegation should include  the description of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed,  including but not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential  segregations of duties where applicable. Delegatees shall inform themselves of the  delegation and the relevant regulations, rules, policies, practices and standards  applicable to any decision or action to be taken under the authority delegated and  cannot claim ignorance of such in defence of any decision or action taken in the  exercise of any delegated authority. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support shall be available to  support delegatees in this regard.   2.6 When an officer-in-charge or an officer ad interim is assigned to a function, the  authorities of the official holding that function shall automatically be delegated on a  temporary basis to the officer-in-charge or the officer ad interim, unless otherwise  specified formally by the official who designated the officer-in-charge or the officer  ad interim.  2.7 A delegation of authority by the Secretary-General to a head of entity entails  personal responsibility for duly discharging the authority and personal accountability  for incorrectly applying or failing to correctly discharge the authority. On the advice  of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance in  __________________    2  Where circumstances require delegation to be made outside the online portal, such delegation  shall be made in writing, with a copy provided to the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance.    ST/SGB/2019/2    3/23  18-21528    consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, the  Secretary-General has the discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input  on the exercise of delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the  delegated authorities, and any such resulting action shall be reflected in the online  portal.  2.8 Within an entity, delegated authority may be further delegated, unless such  further delegation has been excluded by the delegator in the delegation or  subdelegation. Delegators remain accountable and responsible for the exercise of  delegated authority that they subdelegate. Any such subdelegation should be along  reporting lines and on a functional and not a personal basis and therefore be consistent  with the anticipated responsibilities to be performed. The original delegator has the  discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input on the exercise of  delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the delegated authorities,  and any such resulting action shall also be reflected in the online portal.  2.9 A delegatee shall promptly and fully comply with all reporting requirements set  by the delegator and the Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and for Operational Support.   2.10 Any staff member to whom authority is delegated or subdelegated, as the case  may be, in accordance with the present bulletin is accountable for exercising the  highest standards of professionalism and integrity in accordance with the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the standards of conduct for the international civil service.  The exercise of such authority shall be based on considered professional judgment,  in full conformity with the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial Regulation and  Rules, policies, practices and standards and overall interests of the Organization and  subject to the United Nations Secretariat accountability system. 3   2.11 For the purposes of the present bulletin, ""accountability"" is the obligation of  staff members to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and  to be responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception. Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a  timely and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all  mandates to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies  and other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and resources; all  aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions;  and with due recognition to the important role of the oversight bodies and in full  compliance with accepted recommendations.        Section 3      Delegations of authority to be held centrally    3.1 The Secretary-General shall delegate certain authorities to be held and exercised  centrally by the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance or the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support for reasons  including oversight and assurance, coordination of inter-entity operational support  matters, and administration of human resources and physical assets shared between  Secretariat entities. In addition, the Under-Secretaries-General for Operational  Support and for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance may, in consultation  with each other, apply temporary exceptional measures for application in  extraordinary situations.  __________________    3  See A/64/640 and A/72/773.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  4/23    3.2 The authorities to be centrally held and exercised are set out in the annexes to  the present bulletin.         Section 4      Management of authorities delegated to heads of entity    4.1 Heads of entity will receive notification of their delegations of authority from  the Secretary-General and any actions relating to such delegations, such as  amendment, suspension or revocation, through the online portal. The heads of entity  will acknowledge receipt of the delegations to them in their capacity as head of entity  through the portal.   4.2 Through the online portal, the heads of entity will be provided with a description  of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed, including but  not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential segregations of duties  where applicable. Heads of entity will use the online portal to subdelegate authority  and shall be able to view all subdelegations within their entity.   4.3 The authorities delegated to heads of entity are specific to that function and are  not personal in nature. When heads of entity cease to hold the appointment for that  function, they will no longer hold or be able to exercise the authorities delegated to  that function. Pending the appointment of an officer-in-charge, an officer ad interim  or a replacement head of entity, all subdelegations will remain in effect. When the  head of entity is succeeded by another, the duly appointed successor will ordinarily  be afforded the same level of delegations as the predecessor and shall be notified of  and accept the delegations through the online portal. All subdelegations issued by the  predecessor shall remain valid, with the accountability transferring to the successor  unless otherwise withdrawn or modified by the successor.  4.4 The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance is responsible  for monitoring and evaluating compliance with the present bulletin, including  whether any circumstances have arisen that justify the suspension, amendment or  revocation of any delegation, in whole or in part; this may also result in the imposition  of administrative or disciplinary measures. Delegations of authority granted to a head  of entity may be suspended, amended or revoked at any time by the Secretary-General  on the advice of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational  Support. The decision to suspend, amend or revoke (in whole or in part) the  authorities delegated to the heads of entity, including the reasons therefor, shall be  recorded through the online portal. A record of the decision and the reasons for such  action shall be maintained by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.   4.5 In the event that certain delegated authorities of the head of entity are  suspended, amended or revoked or otherwise revised pursuant to section 4.4, the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in  consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, shall make a  recommendation to the Secretary-General on which head of entity should exercise  those authorities until such time as the circumstances giving rise to the suspension,  amendment or revocation of the authorities no longer apply. Where appropriate, the  Department of Operational Support shall work with the entity concerned to enhance  its capability until the required capacity has been developed to the satisfaction of the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   4.6 The Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and for Operational Support shall be able to view all delegations and  subdelegations of authority made through the online portal.

They should decide on the scope and  limit of the authorities to be delegated and the effective date of delegation. The further  delegation of authorities from the head of entity shall be made through the online  portal.  5.2 In circumstances where it is determined by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the head of entity concerned,  that the mandate of that entity requires the subdelegation of specific authorities to the  head of another entity, such subdelegation shall be made through the online portal.   5.3 Authorities subdelegated by the head of entity may be suspended, amended or  revoked, in whole or in part, by the head of entity at any time when circumstances  have arisen that justify such action. The head of entity shall do so through the online  portal and shall communicate the reasons for such action in writing to the delegatee.  A record of the decision and reasons for such action shall be maintained by the head  of the human resources unit of the entity concerned.  5.4 Should there be any changes to the authorities delegated to the head of entity,  whether for policy reasons or to reflect a change in circumstances, the head of entity  shall ensure that concomitant changes are made to any subdelegations to align those  subdelegations with the revised authority vested in the head of entity. Such changes  shall be made through the online portal.         Section 6      Monitoring the exercise of delegated authority      The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will monitor  the use of delegated authority, including through the use of key performance  indicators, to ensure that the delegatees are complying with the applicable legal and  policy framework and internal controls.

Introduction    The United Nations faces a considerable level of risk owing to the complexities of its  operations and increased scope of its mandates.  Risk management is therefore an area already  considered at various levels, and embedded in different processes and operations of the United  Nations Secretariat.  Capital Master Plan1, Information and Communication Technology2,  Security3, Organizational Resilience4, among other areas, have already successfully adopted and  implemented risk management methodologies and practices.    The General Assembly fully recognized the importance of the implementation of a  systematic approach to risk management and internal control in the United Nations, and provided  a clear mandate to the Secretary-General to enhance ""the current capabilities in the Secretariat  responsible for risk assessment and mitigation and internal control on the basis of [...] annex II  to the report of the Secretary-General [A/64/640]""5.    Following the mandates of the General Assembly, and fully in line with the benchmarks  on enterprise risk management implementation recommended by the Joint Inspection Unit  (""JIU"")6, this Policy further expands and strengthens the approach to risk management already  embraced by different areas of the Organization, adopting an integrated Enterprise Risk  Management and Internal Control Framework (""the framework"") that provides a consistent and  comprehensive risk management methodology that can be applied across the entire Secretariat.    Given the operational nature of the work of the Organization and the resultant broad  array of its activities, the framework allows for a strong operational component, and outlines a  flexible structure which can be easily adhered to across the spectrum of activities and work  environments, without resulting in additional administrative overhead for staff members.    The Secretary-General strongly believes enterprise risk management is the inherent core  responsibility of management.  With the adoption of an enterprise risk management and internal  control process as a strategic initiative, the Secretariat defines a consistent methodology for  assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks.  The framework is designed to address  both the strategic risks associated with the execution of the mandates and objectives as defined  by the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the risks inherent in the daily operations that  support the achievement of those mandates, defining a flexible methodology that is fully  compatible with the different risk management practices already adopted by the Organization,                                                    1 ""Capital Master Plan Risk Management Framework"", April 2008.  2 Adoption of ISO 27001, ISO 27002 and Octave Risk Assessment Methodology by the Information and  Communications Technology Board of the Secretariat, April 2008.  3 ""Policies and Guidelines on Security Risk Management and Minimum Operating Security Standards"", April  2009.  4 ""Organizational Resilience Policy for the United Nations Headquarters, New York"", June 2010.  5 Resolution A/RES/63/276 of 26 June 2009 and Resolution A/RES/64/259 of 5 May 2010.  6 ""Review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system: Benchmarking framework"",  JIU/REP/2010/4, Joint Inspection Unit, 2010.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 4 of 15  May 2011  e.g. with regard to security risks.  Properly implemented, it provides insight into potential risks as  well as new opportunities, and shall become a key part of the strategy and planning processes.      II.  Definition    Consistent with the best international standards7 enterprise risk management is defined  as the process of coordinated activities designed to direct and control an organization with regard  to risk, the effect of uncertainty on objectives.  It is applied in strategy-setting throughout the  Organization.    An effective system of internal control is encompassed within and an integral part of  enterprise risk management.  As defined by the best international standards, enterprise risk  management is broader than internal control, expanding and elaborating on internal control to  form a more robust conceptualisation and tool for management.      III.  Purpose    The Secretary-General is convinced that the implementation of this framework will  introduce significant enhancements in the governance and management practices of the  Organization, some of which are outlined below.    (i)  Focus on Objectives - Increased effectiveness in the achievement of the  defined objectives and mandates through a consistent identification, assessment,  and management of risks among Secretariat entities, and the systematic  measurement of risk and performance.  (ii)  Internal Controls - Embedded risk and internal control management activities,  enabling risk management to become an integral part of the processes and  operations of the entire Organization, and determining the type of risk mitigation  or corrective measures necessary to manage the identified risks.  (iii)  Efficient Use of Resources - Improved performance against objectives,  contributing to reduced waste and fraud, better value for money, and a  significantly more efficient use of available resources.  (iv)  Accountability - Enhanced accountability and performance management  through the definition of clear risk management roles and responsibilities.  (v)  Results Based Management - Promotion of a risk driven culture through a  more informed risk based decision-making capability, as the significance of risks  and the effectiveness of designed controls are explicitly considered when  evaluating programmes and relevant budget allocations, according to an  effective results based management approach.  (vi)  Transparency - Improved transparency within the Organization and towards  member states, as risks are clearly communicated internally and externally                                                    7 ""Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework"" and ""Thought Papers on Enterprise Risk  Management"", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, 2004, 2009, 2010 and  2011;  ""Guidelines for Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector"", Internal Control Standards Committee of  the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, 2004 and 2007; and  ""Risk management - Principles and Guidelines"" - International Organization for Standardization, 2009.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 5 of 15  May 2011  through periodic formal reporting by management to the Independent Audit  Advisory Committee (""IAAC"") and the General Assembly.  (vii)  Assurance - Improved assurance over internal controls through the formal  recognition of management's responsibility for effective controls, and the  appropriate management of risks.  (viii)  Oversight - The ability to enhance governance and oversight functions.  (ix)  Governance - An increased capability of senior management to make informed  decisions regarding risk/reward tradeoffs related to existing and new  programmes, through the adoption of a structured approach for the identification  of opportunities to enhance the allocation of resources throughout the  Organization, and reduce related costs.      IV.  Principles    The enterprise risk management and internal control programme is guided by the  following core principles:    (i)  Embedding - Risk management must be explicitly embedded in existing  processes.  Appropriate flexibility needs to be applied in the execution of  strategies and allocation of relevant resources through the proper consideration  of the risks that could affect the achievement of the objectives applicable to each  project, organizational unit, and the Secretariat at entity level.  (ii)  Consistency - The Organization shall adopt, as part of its decision-making  process, a consistent method for the identification, assessment, treatment,  monitoring and communication of risks associated with any of its processes and  functions, in an effort to efficiently and effectively achieve its objectives.  (iii)  Integration - The enterprise risk management and internal control framework  must be fully integrated with the major operational processes, as strategic  planning, operational and financial management.  Risk management shall be in  particular integrated with the adoption of an effective results based management  approach. Enterprise risk management complements results based management  by enabling to effectively achieve set objectives with a clear, shared  understanding of the internal and external uncertainties that may impact  activities.  High priority risks and the effectiveness of related controls shall be  also fully considered in the evaluation of programmes and relevant budget  allocations.    The effective implementation of the framework within the Secretariat shall rely as well  on:    (iv)  Management Ownership  - Risk owners and management across the  Organization must have a sound understanding of the risks impacting their  operations, and the level of flexibility provided to appropriately determine the  available and appropriate course of action to manage those risks, increasing  accountability.  (v)  Risk Aware Culture - A risk-focused and results-oriented culture shall be  nurtured, moving the Organization from the current predominantly risk averse  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 6 of 15  May 2011  culture, where the focus is merely on risk avoidance, to a risk aware culture,  where decisions are driven by a systematic assessment of risks and rewards.   The dissemination of information and best practices with regard to risk and  internal control management principles shall be supported across the  Organization, developing appropriate communication and training programs.  (vi)  Communication - Adequate information shall be provided to senior  management, the Management Committee, the Secretary-General and the  General Assembly.  The governing body, with the advice of the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (""ACABQ"") and the IAAC,  as may be relevant, will be then in a position to effectively fulfil its  responsibilities of determining the risk tolerance of the Organization.    Commitments    The strong support and commitment of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and  senior management are essential for the establishment of effective risk and internal control  management processes.  A sustainable framework shall therefore be based on:    (i)  Support - The endorsement and consistent support from senior management,  confirmed by visible actions, is critical for the successful implementation of the  framework.  (ii)  Accountability - The adoption of an effective framework relies on the full  ownership and accountability of management at each level throughout the  Organization for risk management and internal control activities.  (iii)  Resources - Risk and internal control management shall be supported by  experienced resources, at Department, Office, Commission, Mission and Tribunal  level, as well as at entity level.    United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 7 of 15  May 2011  V.  Process    Enterprise risk m anagement, as defined before, is a process owned and executed by  management.  The main components of the risk management process are illustrated in Figure 1  below, and further described in this section of the document.  The definition of all the relevant  technical terms is included in the Annex of this Policy - Glossary of Terms and Definitions.    Figure 1 - Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control Process    In particular:    (1)  Establishing the Context - Establishing the context encompasses the  definition of the Organization's overall risk management approach, as outlined by  a dedicated policy articulating the purpose, governance mechanisms, and  principles that guide the adoption of the framework.  (2)  Consideration of Risks and Objectives - Risks shall be mapped and aligned  to objectives, mandates and strategic initiatives at both the UN Secretariat and  functional level (Departments, Offices, Commissions, Missions and Tribunals) in  order to measure and prioritise the risk exposure.  Specific measurement criteria  for risk evaluation shall be as well defined.  (3)  Event Identification and Risk Assessment - Risks are assessed in the  context of the objectives, mandates and strategic plans through risk  questionnaires, interviews, workshops with relevant management and staff,  analysis of historical data, and other sources.  Identified risks shall then be  measured and scored according to the weighting of perceived impact, likelihood  and level of internal control effectiveness.  Once the assessment is completed,  the ability to appropriately link risks to both organizational strategies and  objectives, and the underlying processes and activities, is critical to the  identification and implementation of effective risk mitigation measures.

According to best practices,  residual risk is the risk remaining after management has taken action to alter the  risk's likelihood or impact, and shall therefore be the starting point for  determining the appropriate treatment response.  An effective system of internal  control is an integral part of enterprise risk management.  (5)  Information and Communication - Ongoing reporting on results of risk  assessments, including risk treatment plans and actions, shall be established,  supported by adequate information systems. Appropriate communication and  training programs shall be developed across the Organization to nurture the  development of a sound risk aware culture and build adequate capacity and  critical skills.  (6)  Monitoring and Assurance - Ongoing monitoring of risks and internal controls  shall be as well implemented.    A detailed description of the specific steps to be followed in the definition of an effective  enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and of the necessary tools, is  provided in the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control Methodology paper, that  complements this Policy.      VI.  Risk Governance Structure, Roles and Responsibilities    Proper risk governance mechanisms are critical for the adoption of an effective risk  management framework.  This section provides a description of the roles and responsibilities of  the different functions involved, followed by an illustration of the risk management and internal  control governance structure (Figure 2).    General Assembly    The General Assembly, with the advice of the ACABQ and IAAC, is responsible for  determining the risk tolerance of the Organization9.    Secretary-General    Ultimate responsibility for effective risk and internal control management within the  Secretariat resides with the Secretary-General.  The Secretary-General annually reviews with the  Management Committee the significant risks faced by the Organization, and the proposed  strategies designed to effectively mitigate the identified risks at a consolidated entity level, and  accordingly reports to the General Assembly and the IAAC.                                                    8 ""Activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services for the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011"",  A/66/286, 9 August 2011.  9 ""Resolution adopted by the General Assembly - Progress towards an accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat"", A/RES/66/257, 12 April 2012.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 9 of 15  May 2011  Management Committee    The Management Committee, acting as Enterprise Risk Management Committee for the  Secretariat, annually reviews the results of the risk assessments at entity level, and has an active  role in the promotion of the best practices in risk and internal control management in the  Organization, involving other Committees, as may be appropriate.  The Management Committee  shall as well monitor the effectiveness of the enterprise risk management and internal control  framework and recommend any changes that may be required.    Under-Secretaries-General (or equivalent positions)    At the level of each Department, Office, Commission, Mission, or Tribunal, responsibility  for the effective implementation risk management and internal control practices, as described by  this framework, resides with the respective Head of Department, Office, Commission, Mission, or  Tribunal.    As part of the existing senior management compacts with the Secretary-General, each  Under-Secretary-General (or equivalent position) shall annually confirm through a Certification  Report their responsibilities for the proper application of the principles and requirements of this  framework, and the establishment and maintenance of a strong internal control environment as a  result of the risk assessment process.    Local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points    The responsibilities of local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points include the provision of  assistance to local management in the implementation of the risk management requirements  described by this framework, in particular the identification of relevant risks, objectives and  mandates at the Department, Office, Commission, Mission or Tribunal level; the completion of  the risk assessment and reporting on its results; the proposal of the activities that should be  included in the Risk Treatment and Response Plan; and the provision of monitoring and reporting  to senior management on risk management and internal control measures within their area of  responsibility.    In addition, local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points shall customise the Secretariat- wide Risk Universe so that reflects the risks relevant to the Department, Office, Commission,  Mission or Tribunal; prepare reports on all risk management matters, and distribute them to the  Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function, and the responsible Under-Secretary- General, or equivalent position; and monitor the effectiveness of risk management and internal  control measures.    Risk Owners    Risk owners are responsible, amongst other matters, for:    (i)  Regularly reviewing the risks owned by them, informing the local Risk Focal Point  of any identified changes, and escalating the risks for which the relevant impact  or likelihood is perceived having increased.  (ii)  Determining where internal control deficiencies relating to their risks may be  identified, proposing any appropriate risk mitigation measures, and monitoring  risk treatments implementation relating to the risks for which they have  responsibility.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 10 of 15  May 2011  (iii)  Updating relevant risk information and contributing to risk reporting as may be  required.    Risk Treatment Owners    The design and implementation of risk treatment and response plans identified during  the risk assessment process is the responsibility of risk treatment owners.  Their responsibilities  involve implementing the risk treatments for which they are responsible, and reviewing their  effectiveness.    Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function    Enterprise risk management is the inherent core responsibility of management.  Under  the framework, embedded risk and internal control management activities are an integral part of  the processes and operations of the entire Organization.    As recommended by benchmark 4 of the JIU review of enterprise risk management in the  United Nations system10, an Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function shall  assist senior management in the process of establishment of the described framework, and  provide the appropriate level of implementation and execution oversight.    The Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function, that for the short term  shall be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, shall move  towards a future state design stage of separate management function led by a senior  management official reporting to the highest level of the Organization and the Management  Committee, once the function is supported by adequate resources.    Without establishing a new high-level full-time responsible official for risk in the  Organization, a senior management official, acting in this capacity, shall coordinate all the  activities of the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function.  He or she will act  independently and objectively in the execution of his/her duties and responsibilities, fully in line  with the JIU recommended benchmarks 11.    The main responsibilities of the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control  function shall involve, amongst other matters:    (i)  Promoting the application of sound risk management and internal control  policies, and providing oversight for the implementation of related activities  within the UN Secretariat, defining an overall vision and direction for enterprise  risk management and internal control measures.  (ii)  Defining a comprehensive enterprise risk management and internal control  framework across the Organization to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks  and internal controls, supporting the Secretary-General and management in their  efforts to embed and sustain risk management activities in the daily operations  of the Secretariat.                                                    10 Paragraph 84 and 88, ""Review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system:  Benchmarking framework"", JIU/REP/2010/4, Joint Inspection Unit, 2010.  11 Paragraph 91 and 94, JIU/REP/2010/4.

Conclusions    This Policy defines the enterprise risk management and internal control programme that  is formally implemented within the United Nations Secretariat to allow the Organization to  improve its accounta bility and decision making process.  The adoption of this Policy and the  maintenance of an enterprise risk management and internal control process shall provide  reasonable assurance as to the Organization's ability to effectively achieve its mandates and  objectives.    The Policy, as complemented by the Methodology describing the activities to be  performed for the effective implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework, shall be individually applied to each Department, Office, Commission, Mission,  or Tribunal according to the level and context of risk and risk assessment, and shall be reviewed  for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.  It is the responsibility of management to comply with this  Policy and related procedures.    It shall be noted that the full implementation of this Policy and of the Methodology will  require the establishment of a centralized dedicated capacity for Enterprise Risk Management and  Internal Control within the Secretariat, supported by an adequate level of resources, as  recommended by the JIU review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system13.                                                      13 JIU/REP/2010/4.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 14 of 15  May 2011  Annex    Glossary of Terms and Definitions 14      Term  Definition    Enterprise Risk Management    The process of coordinated activities designed to direct and  control an organization with regard to risk, the effect of  uncertainty on objectives.  It is applied in strategy-setting  throughout the Organization.      Internal control is encompassed within and an integral part  of enterprise risk management.    Inherent Risk  The risk to an entity in the absence of any actions  management might take to alter either the risk's likelihood or  impact.    Internal Control  A process, effected by governing bodies, management and  other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the achievement of objectives in the following  categories:  (i)  Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;  (ii)  Reliability of financial reporting;  (iii)  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.    Impact  Result or effect of an event.  There may be a range of  possible impacts associated with an event.  The impact of an  event can be positive or negative relative to the entity's  related objectives.    Likelihood  The possibility that a given event will occur.     Reasonable assurance  The concept that enterprise risk management, even if well  designed and operated, can not provide a guarantee  regarding the achievement of an entity's objectives, due to  the limitations of the human judgement; resource constraints  and the need to consider the cost of controls in relation to  expected benefits; and the possibility of management  override and collusion.    Residual Risk  The remaining risk after management has taken action to  alter the risk's likelihood or impact.                                                      14 Consistent with the best international standards, as ""Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated  Framework"" and ""Thought Papers on Enterprise Risk Management "", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission, 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2011;  ""Guidelines for Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector"", Internal Control Standards Committee of  the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, 2004 and 2007; and  ""Risk management - Principles and Guidelines"" - International Organization for Standardization, 2009.

Typically a four  or multi-quadrant chart is used to display risk assessment  results, as a function of Risk Exposure (Impact times  Likelihood) and Level of Risk Mitigation Activities or Internal  Control Effectiveness.    Risk  The effect of uncertainty on objectives.    Risk Appetite  The broad-based amount of risk a company or other entity is  willing to accept in pursuit of its mission.    Risk Dashboard  Summary of the significant risks identified as a result of the  risk assessment process.  Composite of the risks that have  been assessed to the most critical to the Organization.    Risk Exposure  Magnitude of a risk measured in terms of the combination of  Impact and Likelihood.    Risk Register  Central repository of all risks and risk information maintained  by the Organization, including the risk category, sub- category, risk, risk definition, rating results, contributing  factors, and other relevant information pertaining to that  risk.    Risk Tolerance  The acceptable variation relative to the achievement of an  objective.    Risk Universe, or Risk Catalogue  Extract of the Risk Register containing the risk category, sub- category, risk and risk definition.    Tier 1 Risks  Significant Risks - Risks perceived to be of greatest  importance based on relative level of significance to the  Organization and location, and that require the most  attention.    Tier 2 Risks  Moderate Risks - Those risks which may require focus and  some remedial or monitoring action.    Tier 3 Risks  Lower Risks - Those risks determined to have a relatively  low exposure and residual risk and that require periodic  monitoring to provide assurance that the level of risk  remains constant.          ---   -----   ---    "

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2021/3      Secretariat      6 August 2021    21-11077 (E)    160821      *2111077*         Administrative instruction         Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat        The  Under-Secretary-General  for  Management  Strategy,  Policy  and  Compliance, pursuant to section 4.2 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2009/4  and for the purpose of prescribing instructions and procedures for the implementation  of article VII, Evaluation, of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme  Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation  and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2018/3) promulgates the following:          Section 1     Purpose and scope       1.1 The present instruction describes the Organization's requirements and  procedures for the management, conduct and use of evaluations and sets out the  operational guidelines for article VII, Evaluation, of the Regulations and Rules  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation. It puts into effect the  Secretary-General's intention to strengthen the evaluation capacity of the Secretariat  so as to better inform programme planning and reporting on programme performance,  among other proposals contained in his report on shifting the management paradigm  in the United Nations (A/72/492), which the General Assembly took note of in its  resolution 72/266 A.  1.2 In view of the mandates of the Inspection and Evaluation Division of the Office  of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), as set forth in Secretary-General's bulletins  ST/SGB/273 and ST/SGB/2002/7, and its role as the central evaluation unit referred  to in ST/SGB/2018/3, the present instruction clarifies the architecture of the  evaluation function in the Secretariat. It also outlines the governance arrangements  and accountabilities, as well as performance standards, for evaluation functions in the  Secretariat.   1.3 Evaluation is a shared function across Secretariat entities. The Secretariat  entities are the departments and offices, including offices away from Headquarters,  special political and peacekeeping missions, regional commissions, resident or  regional coordinators' offices and any other unit tasked with programmed activities.  1.4 The Secretary-General's report (A/72/492) and related resolutions and reports  refer to evaluation undertaken by both oversight bodies and entities and to self- evaluation as referenced and defined in section VII of ST/SGB/2018/3. The term  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  2/6    ""evaluation"" is used in the present instruction in reference to both. The provisions of  the instruction apply to all Secretariat entities. Accordingly, all entities are required  to have an evaluation policy that is consistent with the present instruction.  Forthcoming guidance will address transitional measures.         Section 2     Evaluation procedures          Evaluation planning and coverage norms    2.1 Each entity must develop an annual evaluation plan and ensure adequate  allocation of funds for evaluation capacity to deliver the plan. The results of  evaluations and lessons learned must be considered in the preparation of plans and  budgets for future cycles and reported in the budget documents.   2.2 Secretariat entities undertake various types of evaluation, including programme,  thematic and cross-cutting evaluations. The types of evaluation activity undertaken  by each entity depends on its role, mandate and evaluation capacity. The Regulations  and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget,  the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation note the need for  all programmes and subprogrammes to be evaluated on a regular, periodic basis,  irrespective of the source of funding.  2.3 The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS, as the central evaluation unit,  conducts its programme and subprogramme evaluations at least once every eight  years, as specified in the table below. Specifically, the types of evaluation and  evaluative activities and their coverage norms are as follows:    (a)  Programme evaluations assess the overall relevance, effectiveness, impact  and efficiency of a single Secretariat programme or subprogramme or of a  peacekeeping operation or special political mission. As endorsed by the General  Assembly,1   each Secretariat programme is normally evaluated at least once every  eight years;    (b)  Thematic evaluations assess high-risk cross-cutting themes or activities  across multiple Secretariat entities, or the cumulative effects of multiple programmes  sharing common objectives and purposes, or the effectiveness of coordination and  cooperation among different entities. There is normally at least one thematic  evaluation on a cross-cutting theme among the priority areas of work of the  Organization each biennium;    (c)  Inspections are short, focused and targeted reviews of an organizational  unit, issue or practice perceived to be of high risk, in order to determine the extent to  which it adheres to established norms, good practices or other pre-determined criteria,  and to identify corrective action as needed. These are ad hoc and conducted as and  when identified through regular risk assessments;     (d)  Reports on strengthening the role of evaluation and the application of  evaluation findings on programme design, delivery and policy directives together  with the evaluation dashboard are the main products through which the Inspection  and Evaluation Division seeks to strengthen evaluation capacity within the  Secretariat. The reports are produced biennially (ST/SGB/2018/3, regulation 7.4);   __________________    1  In its resolution 65/244 the General Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee  for Programme and Coordination at its fiftieth session (A/65/16) to approve the proposal of  OIOS for a cycle of eight years to cover all Secretariat programmes so as to improve the  programme evaluation cycle (A/65/6 (Prog. 25), para. 25.6).    ST/AI/2021/3    3/6  21-11077      (e)  Triennial reviews are assessments undertaken three years after a General  Assembly mandated inspection or evaluation to review the status of implementation  of report recommendations. All such mandated inspections and evaluations are  subject to triennial reviews (A/37/38, para. 362).   2.4 All entities are subject to the requirement that all programmed activities shall  be evaluated by the entity itself, by OIOS or by an external entity such as the Joint  Inspection Unit and other external bodies as approved by the General Assembly, as  specified in regulations 7.2 and 7.3 of the Rules and Regulations. Evaluation coverage  norms and criteria for consideration in establishing the periodicity of evaluations are  outlined in the table below. As such, Secretariat entities shall establish clearly, within  their respective evaluation policies, the specific regular periodic basis within which  all programmes and subprogrammes under their responsibility are evaluated. OIOS  and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance shall provide  guidance on evaluation planning to ensure coordination and adequate evaluation  coverage of the Secretariat.

The norms and standards for evaluation of the United Nations  Evaluation Group provide additional non-binding advice on the conduct and  management of evaluations.   2.6 Evaluations shall follow key minimum parameters to ensure useful and credible  results:  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  4/6      (a)  Management arrangements for each evaluation shall ensure impartiality  and independence. The designated evaluation manager and team members shall not  be part of the team that designs or manages the implementation of the assessed policy,  plan or programme;    (b)  Entities shall develop an inception report or terms of reference that will  contain an evaluation objective, evaluation questions and evaluation design and  methods;    (c)  Evaluation results, lessons learned and recommendations shall be  incorporated and reflected in planning and budget documents so as to inform strategic  and transparent programme delivery (as specified in ST/SGB/2018/3, rule 107.4).        Quality assurance    2.7 The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS, in consultation with the  Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, develops and provides guidance and  tools to support the conduct of evaluations.   2.8 Heads of entities are responsible for the existence of an appropriate quality  assurance system in their respective entities. The quality assurance system shall  include a clear process, with specific and transparent standards, for assessing the  overall quality of evaluation using agreed professional standards for the conduct of  evaluation. OIOS and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will provide guidance on minimum quality standards. When Secretariat  entities need assistance in conducting quality assurance at key points in the conduct  of an evaluation, they may request such assistance from the Inspection and Evaluation  Division of OIOS. Key points include identifying evaluation resources such as  consultants; preparing terms of reference, including developing potential  methodology; during the inception phase when finalizing the evaluation design; at the  time of the draft inception report; and at the time of the draft evaluation report.           Section 3     Use of evaluation data, findings and follow-up      3.1 Heads of entities shall promote the use of evaluation data, findings and follow- up through an interactive process that involves programme managers in the entity  being evaluated, end users and other relevant officials. Heads of entities shall also  ensure that recommendations, findings and lessons learned are considered in planning  and in the preparation of budgets for future cycles and are integrated into policies and  programmes.         Management response to evaluation recommendations    3.2 Management in all entities is required to prepare a response to each evaluation.  Management responses to recommendations shall be discussed with programme  managers and include specific, time-bound actions. In instances where Management  decides to adopt recommendations made pursuant to an evaluation, it shall do so by  clearly assigning responsibilities to units that will implement the recommendations.  Management responses shall be made public, except for circumstances in which such  response would divulge confidential information.         ST/AI/2021/3    5/6  21-11077       Section 4     Complementarity with other learning and oversight functions      4.1  The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS and the evaluation units of  Secretariat entities rely on data and information from other functions such as programme  and performance monitoring, research and audit. While maintaining independence, the  Division and Secretariat evaluation units coordinate with internal and external oversight  bodies such as the Internal Audit Division of OIOS, the Board of Auditors and the Joint  Inspection Unit to ensure that evaluations can take advantage of efficiencies in the  generation and use of data and evidence for assessing organizational effectiveness.   4.2 Secretariat entities may request the Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS  and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to support the  utilization of relevant performance monitoring systems and data for evaluations and  facilitate the sharing of information and lessons learned.         Section 5     Provisions on roles and responsibilities of the Evaluation  Management Committee, the Evaluation Advisory Committee and  Secretariat entities          Evaluation Management Committee    5.1  The Evaluation Management Committee will be a subcommittee of the  Secretary-General's Management Committee, chaired by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The Business  Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will serve as the secretariat to assist the Committee  in exercising its mandate.  5.2 The Evaluation Management Committee advises the Secretary-General (or  designate) on issues relating to the planning, budgeting and policies related to  evaluation. It is intended to foster demand and use of evaluation within the  Organization, to raise awareness of the added value of evaluation and to ensure that  accountabilities for uptake and use of evaluation results are exercised, including  management response and follow-up on the implementation of recommendations.        Evaluation Advisory Committee    5.3 The Evaluation Advisory Committee is an independent external body, appointed  by the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services to advise the Director  of the Inspection and Evaluation Division on issues relating to the evaluation  function, including implementation of the evaluation policy; risk-based planning of  evaluations; recommending improvements to evaluation methodologies, procedures,  quality assurance mechanisms and management response; and ways to enhance the  use of evaluations. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division has  observer status in the Evaluation Advisory Committee.        Secretariat entities    5.4 Evaluation is an integral part of the management of the programme planning  and budgetary cycle. Each head of entity is responsible for ensuring the establishment  of the entity's evaluation policy and an adequately resourced evaluation capacity.   5.5 All heads of Secretariat entities shall:    (a)  Ensure that the conduct of evaluation is functionally independent within  the entity;  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  6/6      (b)  Ensure the integration of respect for gender equality and disability  inclusion in evaluation procedures and practices;    (c)  Use qualified external and internal evaluators with relevant professional  competencies and experience, including evaluators from the roster developed and  maintained by the Inspection and Evaluation Division where in-house capacity is  lacking;    (d)  Ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place for management to monitor  and respond to evaluation recommendations, including outlining concrete actions that  are to be undertaken, and to follow up on recommendation implementation;      (e)  Conduct joint evaluations with other Secretariat entities on cross-cutting  areas, including those that contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable  Development Goals, with coordination by the Inspection and Evaluation Division as  required.         Section 6     Resources      6.1  Heads of entities shall ensure adequate capacity and resources to manage and  conduct evaluations and provide effective quality assurance. Heads of entities shall also  ensure that there is adequate capacity to deliver these key roles. Some of these services  may be provided directly by the entity itself, or they may be provided through other  arrangements such as consultancies or long-term agreements with centres of excellence.2  6.2 Secretariat entities shall take into consideration the general view of the Joint  Inspection Unit that funding for evaluation activities should fall within the range of  0.5 to 3 per cent of entity expenditure, depending on the mandate of the entity, its  size, types of evaluation undertaken and the role of evaluation in the entity  (JIU/REP/2014/6, para. 77).          Section 7     Implementation, reporting and review      7.1 The present instruction will come into force at the time of its issuance.   7.2  In accordance with rules 107.2 and 107.3 of the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, the Inspection and Evaluation Division  of OIOS, as the central evaluation unit, will provide further guidance, with support from  the Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, on the implementation of the present  instruction. Nothing in the instruction shall be construed as limiting the operational  independence of OIOS with regard to its mandated activities.  7.3 The instruction will be reviewed two years from the date of issuance.

Commitments against appropriations for future budget periods      Regulation 5.7. The Secretary-General may enter into commitments for future  budget periods, provided that such commitments:    (a)  Are for activities which have been approved by the General  Assembly and are expected to continue beyond the end of the current budget  period; or    (b) Are authorized by specific decisions of the Assembly.        Rule 105.2      In accordance with regulation 5.7, the authority to approve commitments  against future budget periods is delegated to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management.

B. Commitments and expenses           Authority and responsibility      Regulation 5.9. Commitments for current or future budget periods shall be  incurred only after allotments or other appropriate authorizations have been  issued under the authority of the Secretary-General.    13-40857  19      ST/SGB/2013/4     Rule 105.3      The utilization of all funds requires the prior authorization of the Under- Secretary-General for Management. Such authorization may take the form of:    (a)  An allotment of funds or other authorization to incur commitments and  expend specified funds for specified purposes during a specified period;    (b)  An authorization to employ staff against an approved staffing table.           Checks and balances          Rule 105.4      Notwithstanding bank signatory functions assigned in accordance with rule  104.5, all commitments, disbursements and expenses require at least two authorizing  signatures, in either conventional or electronic form. All commitments,  disbursements and expenses must first be signed (""certified"") by a duly designated  certifying officer (rule 105.5). Following certification, duly designated approving  officers (rule 105.6) must then sign to ""approve"" the establishment of commitments,  expenses and disbursements. Expenses recorded against an established, certified  commitment do not require additional certification, provided that they do not exceed  the amount committed by more than 10 per cent or $4,000 (or its equivalent in other  currencies), whichever is lower (rule 105.7). Expenses under $4,000 (or its  equivalent in other currencies) for which the recording of a commitment is  unnecessary require both certification and approval.           Certifying officers          Rule 105.5      (a)  One or more officials shall be designated by the Under-Secretary-General  for Management as the certifying officer(s) for the account(s) pertaining to a section  or subsection of an approved budget. Certifying authority and responsibility is  assigned on a personal basis and cannot be delegated. A certifying officer cannot  exercise the approving functions assigned in accordance with rule 105.6.     (b)  Certifying officers are responsible for managing the utilization of  resources, including posts, in accordance with the purposes for which those  resources were approved, the principles of efficiency and effectiveness, and the  Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. Certifying officers must  maintain detailed records of all commitments, disbursements and expenses against  the accounts for which they have been delegated responsibility. They must be  prepared to submit any supporting documents, explanations and justifications  requested by the Under-Secretary-General for Management.    (c)  In cases where the goods/services received and the invoice received are  consistent with the details of the commitment, the certification may be deemed to  have taken place at commitment.        20    13-40857    ST/SGB/2013/4         Approving officers          Rule 105.6      (a) Approving officers are designated by the Under-Secretary-General for  Management to approve the entry into the accounts of commitments, disbursements  and expenses relating to contracts, agreements, purchase orders and other forms of  undertaking after verifying that they are in order and have been certified by a duly  designated certifying officer. Approving officers are also responsible for approving  the making of payments once they have ensured that they are properly due,  confirming that the necessary goods and services have been received in accordance  with the contract, agreement, purchase order or other form of undertaking by which  they were ordered and, if the cost exceeds $4,000 (or its equivalent in other  currencies), in accordance with the purpose for which the relevant financial  commitment was established. Approving officers must maintain detailed records and  must be prepared to submit any supporting documents, explanations and  justifications requested by the Under-Secretary-General for Management.    (b)  Approving authority and responsibility is assigned on a personal basis  and cannot be delegated. An approving officer cannot exercise the certifying  functions assigned in accordance with rule 105.5 or the bank signatory functions  assigned in accordance with rule 104.5.    (c)  In cases where the goods/services received and the invoice received are  consistent with the details of the commitment, the approval may be deemed to have  taken place at commitment.           Establishment and revision of commitments          Rule 105.7      (a) Apart from the employment of staff against an authorized staffing table  and consequential commitments under the Staff Regulations and Rules and  allocations made to executing agencies, no undertaking, including by contract,  agreement or purchase order, for an amount exceeding $4,000 (or its equivalent in  other currencies) shall be entered into until the appropriate credit(s) has (have) been  reserved in the accounts by the certifying officer. This shall be done through the  recording of commitments against which relevant payments or disbursements may  be made. A commitment shall remain open until such point as it is liquidated,  cancelled or recommitted in accordance with regulations 5.4 and 5.5, as appropriate.    (b)  If, in the time that elapses between the establishment of a commitment  and the processing of final payment, the cost of the relevant goods or services has,  for whatever reason, increased by less than $4,000 (or its equivalent in other  currencies) or 10 per cent of the commitment, whichever is lower, no change need  be made to the amount of the original commitment. If, however, the increase in  costs exceeds $4,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies), the original commitment  must be revised to reflect this increase in requirements and further certification is  required. All increases in commitments shall be subject to the same procedures as  apply to the incurring of original commitments.    13-40857  21      ST/SGB/2013/4      Review, recommitment and cancellation of commitments          Rule 105.8      (a)  Outstanding commitments must be reviewed periodically by the  responsible certifying officer(s). If a commitment is determined to be valid but  cannot be liquidated during the period set forth in regulation 5.3, the provisions of  regulations 5.4 and 5.5 shall, as appropriate, be applied. Commitments that are no  longer valid shall be cancelled from the accounts forthwith and the resulting credit  surrendered.    (b)  When any commitment previously recorded in the accounts is, for any  reason, reduced (other than by payment) or cancelled, the certifying officer shall  accordingly ensure that appropriate adjustments are recorded in the accounts.           Commitment documents          Rule 105.9      A commitment must be based on a formal contract, agreement, purchase order  or other form of undertaking, or on a liability recognized by the United Nations. All  commitments must be supported by an appropriate commitment document.           Peacekeeping reimbursements      Regulation 5.10. Member States that contribute troops and formed police to  peacekeeping operations shall be reimbursed at rates approved by the General  Assembly. Member States shall also be reimbursed for contingent-owned  equipment at rates approved by the Assembly.        Rule 105.10      The payment of reimbursements to Member States, based upon rates and  peacekeeping operation budgets approved by the General Assembly, may be made  only with the approval of the Under-Secretary-General for Management.

(b)  Each management and support services arrangement shall be covered by  a written agreement between the United Nations and the entity on whose behalf the  services are to be provided. Such agreements shall, inter alia, specify the services  which the United Nations is to provide in return for full reimbursement to the  United Nations of any costs incurred by it in providing those services.        22    13-40857    ST/SGB/2013/4         Ex gratia payments      Regulation 5.11.

Rule 105.12      Ex gratia payments may be made in cases where, although in the opinion of  the Legal Counsel there is no clear legal liability on the part of the United Nations,  payment is in the interest of the Organization. A summary statement of all ex gratia  payments shall be provided to the Board of Auditors not later than three months  following the end of the financial period. The approval of the Under-Secretary- General for Management is required for all ex gratia payments.        C. Procurement           General principles      Regulation 5.12.

Formal methods of solicitation          Rule 105.15      (a)  When a formal invitation to bid has been issued, the procurement  contract shall be awarded to the qualified bidder whose bid substantially conforms  to the requirements set forth in the solicitation documents and is evaluated to be the  one with the lowest cost to the United Nations.    (b)  When a formal request for proposals has been issued, the procurement  contract shall be awarded to the qualified proposer whose proposal, all factors  considered, is the most responsive to the requirements set forth in the solicitation  documents.    24    13-40857    ST/SGB/2013/4      (c)  The Under-Secretary-General for Management may, in the interest of the  United Nations, reject bids or proposals for a particular procurement action,  recording the reasons for rejection in writing.

Exceptions to the use of formal methods of solicitation          Rule 105.16      (a)  The Under-Secretary-General for Management may determine for a  particular procurement action that using formal methods of solicitation is not in the  best interest of the United Nations:    (i)  When there is no competitive marketplace for the requirement, such as  where a monopoly exists, where prices are fixed by legislation or government  regulation or where the requirement involves a proprietary product or service;  (ii) When there has been a previous determination or there is a need to  standardize the requirement;  (iii) When the proposed procurement contract is the result of cooperation with  other organizations of the United Nations system, pursuant to rule 105.17;  (iv) When offers for identical products and services have been obtained  competitively within a reasonable period and the prices and conditions offered  remain competitive;  (v)  When, within a reasonable prior period, a formal solicitation has not  produced satisfactory results;  (vi) When the proposed procurement contract is for the purchase or lease of  real property and market conditions do not allow for effective competition;  (vii) When there is an exigency for the requirement;  (viii) When the proposed procurement contract relates to obtaining services  that cannot be evaluated objectively;  (ix) When  the  Under-Secretary-General  for  Management  otherwise  determines that a formal solicitation will not give satisfactory results;  (x)  When the value of the procurement is below the monetary threshold  established for formal methods of solicitation.    (b)  When a determination is made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the  Under-Secretary-General for Management shall record the reasons in writing and  may then award a procurement contract, either on the basis of an informal method of  solicitation or on the basis of a directly negotiated contract, to a qualified vendor  whose offer substantially conforms to the requirement at an acceptable price.    13-40857  25      ST/SGB/2013/4      Cooperation          Rule 105.17      (a)  The Under-Secretary-General for Management may cooperate with other  organizations of the United Nations system to meet the procurement requirements of  the United Nations, provided that the regulations and rules of those organizations  are consistent with those of the United Nations.

(b)  When a formal request for proposals has been issued, the  procurement contract shall be awarded to the qualified proposer whose proposal,  all factors considered, is the most responsive to the requirements set forth in the  solicitation documents.      (c)  The Secretary-General may, in the interest of the United Nations, reject  bids or proposals for a particular procurement action, recording the reasons for  rejection in writing. The Secretary-General shall then determine whether to  undertake a new solicitation, to directly negotiate a procurement contract pursuant  to rule 105.16 or to terminate or suspend the procurement action.          Rule 105.16        (a)  The Secretary-General may determine for a particular procurement  action that using formal methods of solicitation is not in the best interest of the  United Nations:      (i)  When there is no competitive marketplace for the requirement, such  as where a monopoly exists, where prices are fixed by legislation or  government regulation or where the requirement involves a proprietary  product or service;      (ii) When there has been a previous determination or there is a need to  standardize the requirement;      (iii) When the proposed procurement contract is the result of cooperation  with other organizations of the United Nations system, pursuant to rule  105.17;      (iv) When offers for identical products and services have been obtained  competitively within a reasonable period and the prices and conditions  offered remain competitive;      (v)  When, within a reasonable prior period, a formal solicitation has not  produced satisfactory results;      (vi) When the proposed procurement contract is for the purchase or lease  of real property and market conditions do not allow for effective  competition;      (vii) When there is an exigency for the requirement;      (viii) When the proposed procurement contract relates to obtaining  services that cannot be evaluated objectively;  ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1      18-21493  10/12        (ix) When the Secretary-General otherwise determines that a formal  solicitation will not give satisfactory results;      (x)  When the value of the procurement is below the monetary threshold  established for formal methods of solicitation.      (b)  When a determination is made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the  Secretary-General shall record the reasons in writing and may then award a  procurement contract, either on the basis of an informal method of solicitation  or on the basis of a directly negotiated contract, to a qualified vendor whose  offer substantially conforms to the requirement at an acceptable price.          Rule 105.17        (a)  The Secretary-General may cooperate with other organizations of the  United Nations system to meet the procurement requirements of the United  Nations, provided that the regulations and rules of those organizations are  consistent with those of the United Nations. The Secretary-General may, as  appropriate, enter into agreements for such purposes. Such cooperation may  include carrying out common procurement actions together or the United  Nations entering into a contract relying on a procurement decision of another  United Nations organization or requesting another United Nations organization  to carry out procurement activities on behalf of the United Nations.      (b)  The Secretary-General may, to the extent authorized by the General  Assembly, cooperate with a Government, non-governmental organization or  other public international organization in respect of procurement activities and,  as appropriate, enter into agreements for such purposes.          Rule 105.18        (a)  Written procurement contracts shall be used to formalize every  procurement action with a monetary value exceeding specific thresholds  established by the Secretary-General. Such arrangements shall, as appropriate,  specify in detail:      (i)  The nature of the products or services being procured;      (ii) The quantity being procured;      (iii) The contract or unit price;      (iv) The period covered;      (v)  Conditions to be fulfilled, including the United Nations general  conditions of contract and implications for non-delivery;      (vi) Terms of delivery and payment;      (vii) Name and address of the supplier.      (b)  The requirement for written procurement contracts shall not be  interpreted to restrict the use of any electronic means of data interchange. Before  any electronic means of data interchange is used, the Secretary-General shall  ensure that the electronic data interchange system is capable of ensuring  authentication and confidentiality of the information transmitted.          Rule 105.19        (a)  Except where normal commercial practice or the interests of the  United Nations so require, no contract or other form of undertaking shall be  made on behalf of the United Nations which requires a payment or payments on    ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1    11/12  18-21493    account in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of contractual  services. Whenever an advance payment is agreed to, the reasons therefor shall  be recorded.      (b)  In addition to paragraph (a) above and notwithstanding rule 105.2,  the Secretary-General may, where necessary, authorize progress payments.          Rule 105.20        The Secretary-General is responsible for the management of the property,  plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations,  including all systems governing their receipt, valuation, recording, utilization,  safekeeping, maintenance, transfer and disposal, including by sale, and shall  designate the officials responsible for performing property management  functions.          Rule 105.21        Physical verification shall be carried out and records maintained of  property, plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the  Organization, in accordance with policies established by the Secretary-General.          Rule 105.22        (a)  The  Secretary-General  shall  establish  review  bodies  for  Headquarters and other locations to render written advice in respect of loss,  damage, impairment or other discrepancy regarding the property, plant and  equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations. The  Secretary-General shall establish the composition and terms of reference of such  review bodies, which shall include procedures for determining the cause of such  loss, damage, impairment or other discrepancy, the disposal action to be taken  in accordance with rules 105.23 and 105.24 and the degree of responsibility, if  any, attaching to any official of the United Nations or other party for such loss,  damage or other discrepancy.      (b)  Where the advice of a review body is required, no final action in  respect of United Nations property loss, damage, impairment or other  discrepancy may be taken before such advice is received. In cases where the  Secretary-General decides not to accept the advice of such a body, he or she  shall record in writing, the reasons for that decision.          Rule 105.23        Property, plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the  United Nations that are declared surplus, unserviceable or obsolete following a  recommendation by a review body shall be disposed of, transferred or sold after  competitive bidding, unless the review body:      (a)  Estimates that the sales value is less than an amount to be specified  by the Secretary-General;      (b)  Considers that the exchange of property in partial or full payment for  replacement equipment or supplies is in the best interest of the Organization;      (c)  Deems it appropriate to transfer surplus property from one project or  operation for use in another and determines the fair market value at which the  transfer(s) shall be effected;  ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1      18-21493  12/12        (d)  Determines that the destruction of the surplus or unserviceable  material will be more economical or is required by law or by the nature of the  property;      (e)  Determines that the interests of the United Nations will be served  through the disposal of the property by gift or by sale at a nominal price to an  intergovernmental organization, a Government or governmental agency or some  other non-profit organization.           Article VI        Accounting            Rule 106.2        Responsibility for the accounts is assigned to the Secretary-General, who  shall establish accounting systems.          Rule 106.5        (a)  The Secretary-General shall establish the operational rates of  exchange between the United States dollar and other currencies. The operational  rates of exchange shall be used for recording all United Nations transactions.      (b)  Receipts and payments in currencies other than the United States  dollar shall be recorded on the basis of the operational rate of exchange  prevailing on the transaction date. Any difference between the actual amount on  exchange and the amount that would have been obtained at the operational rate  of exchange shall be accounted for as loss or gain on exchange.      (c)  When closing the final accounts for a financial period, any negative  balance on the account for ""loss or gain on exchange"" shall be debited to other  expenses, while any positive balance on the account for ""loss or gain on  exchange"" shall be credited to other/miscellaneous revenue.          Rule 106.7        (a)  The Secretary-General may, after investigation, authorize the  writing-off of losses of assets, including cash, receivables, property, plant and  equipment, inventories and intangible assets. A summary statement of losses  shall be provided to the Board of Auditors not later than three months following  the end of the financial period.      (b)  The investigation shall in each case fix the responsibility, if any,  attaching to any official(s) of the United Nations for the loss or losses. Such  official(s) may be required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or  in full. Final determination as to all surcharges to be made against staff members  or others as the result of losses will be made by the Secretary-General.          Rule 106.8        Accounting and other financial records and all supporting documents shall  be retained for established periods in accordance with policies after which, on  approval of the Secretary-General, they may be destroyed.  5.

Section 3     Types and categories of property      3.1 Property of the United Nations is either ""tangible property"" or ""intangible  property"" over which the United Nations exercises dominion and control, whether  as a result of an acquisition, a gift or devise or an agreement for its short-term or  long-term use. In some cases, tangible property of the United Nations may also have  intangible property rights concurrently associated with the tangible property itself.   3.2 ""Tangible property"" of the United Nations consists of either:    (a)  Immovable property, which is property that takes the form of land and/or  any buildings or other structures erected thereon, whether owned by the United  Nations or used under a lease or other licence, together with any plant, equipment,  structures, landscaping or other objects that are permanently affixed to the land or  appurtenant to such land, including easements and other rights associated with such  land;     (b)  Moveable property, which is any property that has a physical form and  that cannot otherwise be defined as immovable property (as defined in sect. 3.2 (a)),  whether such property is owned by the United Nations or used under a lease or other  licence, and includes, without limitation, equipment, machinery, vehicles,  communication and information technology equipment, furniture and fittings, and  expendable items that are not an integral part of or otherwise affixed to immovable  property and that can be used elsewhere if uninstalled from their previous locations.  3.3 ""Intangible property"" of the United Nations, whether owned by, licensed to or  otherwise acquired and used by the United Nations by right, consists of any  property that does not have a physical form and commonly consists of intellectual  property, such as patents, copyrighted materials, trademarks and other legally  protected marks and identifiers (including names, acronyms, armorial bearings,  flags and logos), whether developed by:    ST/AI/2015/4    3/5  15-10823      (a)  Staff members as part of their official duties and activities, in accordance  with staff rule 1.9;    (b)  Contractors or consultants, for the exclusive use of the United Nations,  pursuant to the terms of the applicable contracts or other agreements;     (c)  Third parties and provided to, made available to or otherwise used by, the  United Nations under the applicable agreements governing such use.

Physical verification of the property of the United  Nations shall be conducted regularly and as deemed necessary to ensure adequate  control over the property.   6.3 Expendable property shall be monitored and controlled until it is issued for use  or consumption. A physical verification may be performed when, in the discretion of  the head of department or office concerned, such verification is necessary to ensure  adequate control over the property and accountability.   6.4 For capitalized property, the physical verification shall be performed at least  once during each financial year. The findings of the verification process shall be  reconciled with the property records.   6.5 For intangible property, the verification shall be conducted at such times, with  such frequency and using such methods as are necessary and appropriate, or as may  be required by an agreement with a third party in order to ensure the appropriate use  and custody of the intangible property. Appropriate control systems for intangible  property shall be put in place.   6.6 Property of the United Nations that has been issued by a department or office  to staff members for use outside United Nations premises shall be monitored to  ensure that it is properly accounted for and that related records are maintained.   6.7 Property of the United Nations issued to, made available to, or otherwise used  by, a staff member shall be returned to the United Nations, through, if possible, the  issuing department or office, when required by the issuing department or office,  upon the staff member's separation from service, or, if required, upon his or her  reassignment or transfer to another department or office.

The report comes at a time when the United Nations has faced an unprecedented series of organizational challenges. In response to these challenges, the Secretary-General has revisited the existing mechanisms of accountability and oversight and developed a set of measures based on three main pillars, namely, accountability; transparency; and ethics. The report outlines these new measures, and others that were already initiated, and presents them under the following thematic headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; strengthening the oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and other measures. In addition, the report responds to two other requests of the General Assembly, as contained in its resolutions 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, namely: to report, respectively, on (a) an analysis of experiences with audit committees derived from a review conducted by the Secretariat; and (b) progress made on indicating time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies, both of which are an integral part of the measures being taken to improve accountability. * A/60/150. ** Owing to extensive consultations, submission of the present report was delayed. 2 A/60/312 Contents Paragraphs Page   I.

Introduction 1. The present report has been submitted pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, in which the Assembly mandated the Secretary-General to submit annually to the Assembly a report under the agenda item entitled ""Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations"" addressing the measures aimed at strengthening accountability in the Secretariat. This report also responds to paragraph 11 of resolution 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and paragraph 7 of resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, in which the Assembly called, respectively, for an assessment of the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, and an assessment of progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 2. Since the submission to the General Assembly of the last report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Accountability and responsibility"" (A/55/270 of 3 August 2000), there have been continuing efforts to strengthen accountability at the United Nations. However, the Secretariat is now facing an unprecedented series of organizational challenges which have exposed shortcomings in the way it conducts its business. The Secretary-General is therefore taking additional actions where it is within his authority to do so, particularly in the critical areas of the accountability framework, oversight, ethics and transparency. 3. This report is organized into six parts covering the following headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; assessment of experiences with audit committees; establishment of oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and timely implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies. II. Measures to strengthen the accountability framework 4. The accountability framework at the United Nations is based on a hierarchy headed by the General Assembly that flows through the Secretary-General, senior managers and middle management to all other staff. Annex I to this report provides a schematic representation of this structure and the mechanisms that support it. At each level in the hierarchy, it is essential that there be clearly defined responsibilities and performance expectations and that there be mechanisms in place that enable both routine and formal assessment of performance. The measures described in the present section of this report are aimed at ensuring that: (a) the Secretary-General receives the necessary advice to properly assess the performance of senior managers; (b) executive-level decisions are clearly understood and followed up; (c) senior managers understand what is expected from them; and (d) the mechanism for formal appraisal of all staff, including managers, is improved. A. Reconstituting of the Accountability Panel as the Management Performance Board 5. Through the promulgation of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/13, which took effect from 13 May 2005, the Secretary-General has replaced the 5 A/60/312 Accountability Panel with the Management Performance Board. The Board's terms of reference and responsibilities are clearer and better defined than those of the Panel. The Board will advise the Secretary-General on matters concerning the performance of individual senior managers. Its functions include reviewing the material recommendations of the Oversight Committee (see sect. IV of this report) and ensuring that managers act on serious managerial issues identified by its oversight bodies. It will also monitor the manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans, and review the outcome of the administration of justice proceedings in the Secretariat for management accountability purposes. 6. The members of the Management Performance Board will be appointed by the Secretary-General for a two-year term, which may be renewable. Its membership will consist of a chairperson, who will be the Deputy Secretary-General, two members at the Under-Secretary-General level and an external expert in public sector management. 7. In July 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General chaired the first organizational meeting of the Management Performance Board, which conducted a review of existing sources of managerial performance data. The Department of Management was requested to review methods of performance assessments used in other comparable organizations, with a view to preparing proposals for a set of qualitative and quantitative performance indicators covering both programmatic and managerial functions that would enable a high-level evaluation of a senior manager's performance. The Board is expected to consider these proposals at its next meeting in the fourth quarter of 2005. B. Improving executive-level decision-making 8. Recognizing the value in having the ability to take high-level decisions on a timely basis and in an effort to ensure that mechanisms would be in place to hold senior management accountable for follow-up action, the Secretary-General established a Senior Management Group as part of his initial reform programme in 1997. The Group comprised all heads of Secretariat departments and United Nations offices, funds and programmes. As a result, coordination and coherence within the United Nations family have since been enhanced. In practice, however, while having real utility as an information-sharing body, the Group has proved too large for effective and timely decision-making. Consequently, two smaller senior-level committees, a Policy Committee and a Management Committee -- both chaired by the Secretary-General -- have been created. The modus operandi of these Committees will ensure clear expectations, and clear definition of responsibility and timelines for implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Policy Committee had met on six occasions since its establishment in May 2005 and has presented the Secretary- General with policy options on a wide range of issues. The Management Committee held its first meeting on 20 May 2005 to review progress made to date on management reform and later met in July 2005 to endorse a number of reform proposals. 6 A/60/312 C. Introducing mandatory induction programmes for senior officials 9. A more robust approach to ensuring that senior officials are adequately informed on the broader system of United Nations regulations and rules, code of conduct and managerial systems is required. To meet this need, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations piloted its first induction session in June 2005 for a group of newly appointed leaders in a number of field missions. The programme, which is intended to be conducted biannually, will cover sessions on conduct and requirements for management performance. At the same time, a broader induction programme for senior-level recruits is being developed in the rest of the United Nations Secretariat. It is expected that this will be launched by the end of 2005. A consolidated reference guide on delegation of authority has been prepared and will act both as a training aid during the induction programmes and as a reference document designed to clarify the responsibilities that are delegated to senior officials. D. Defining performance expectations for programme delivery 10. An essential component of the accountability framework is the clear and meaningful measurement of programme delivery. To this end, as part of the Secretary-General's first round of reforms, results-based budgeting was introduced. A comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes, including peacekeeping missions, have now been developed. For the programme budget for 2004-2005 and the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, performance measures, namely, baselines and targets, have also been included. 11. To gain maximum benefit from these performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation are being enhanced. The Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its latest recommendations on this subject to the General Assembly in its reports on strengthening the role of evaluation findings in programme design, delivery and policy directives (see A/59/79) and further specific proposals (which were prepared jointly with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)) on the strengthening and monitoring of programme  performance  and  evaluation  (A/60/73).  The  measures  being implemented will include improvements in data-collection and monitoring systems and strengthening of self-evaluation. Programme managers are required to include in their budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme performance. 12. The improvements in monitoring and evaluation combined with the performance indicators contained in the biennial programme plan and the programme budget will provide the basis for objective reporting of performance both to Member States through the programme performance report and to the new Management Performance Board. These inputs, together with the independent inspection and evaluation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU, will put the Board in a position to provide the Secretary-General with the advice he needs to hold his senior managers accountable for the results they achieve in delivering their work programmes. 7 A/60/312 E. Enhancing the Performance Appraisal System 13. As part of the overall accountability framework, the e-PAS is the formal tool employed in holding staff accountable for their performance. The system has the basic objective of creating a fair, equitable, transparent and measurable system of performance management in support of a results-based culture that recognizes and rewards excellent performance while adequately addressing underperformance. The system applies to all staff and managers except the heads of departments who are currently subject to annual assessment through their programme management plans. The e-PAS represents an enhancement of the original Performance Appraisal System (PAS), and was introduced after extensive consultations throughout the Secretariat. Incorporated into the revised e-PAS system are the following features: (a) The organizational core values and competencies, in order to provide a fuller picture of performance; (b) Self-assessment by staff members; (c) The managerial competencies for supervisory staff so as to provide an assessment of their supervisory skills; (d) Strengthened links between performance management and career development; (e) Enhanced accountability measures such as the inclusion of an optional section in the e-PAS for the comments of staff on supervision received. F. Requiring personal financial liability of staff 14. The Secretary-General has defined the conditions, through staff rules 112.3, 212.2 and 312.2, under which staff members may be required to reimburse the United Nations, either partially or in full, for any financial loss suffered by the Organization as a result of the staff member's gross negligence or violation of the regulations and procedures. To that end, administrative instruction ST/AI/2004/3 of 29 September 2004 was promulgated. The instructions also define the conditions for implementing financial rule 101.2, under which any staff member who violates the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) or corresponding administrative instructions, may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions. III. Assessment of experience with audit and oversight committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations 15. At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/264 A, having taken note of the Secretariat's effort in collecting information on the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, requested the Secretary-General to report on and provide an assessment of its findings to the Assembly at its sixtieth session. 8 A/60/312 16. The Secretariat collected the information on audit committees during 2004. Thirty-three organizations were involved, grouped in four categories: specialized agencies and related organizations; funds and programmes; multinational financial institutions; and other international organizations. The Secretariat's analysis revealed that 60 per cent of the organizations involved in the survey had already established an oversight mechanism (see annex II). These oversight mechanisms were referred to as either audit committees or oversight committees. It is worth noting that even the organizations that do not have an institutionalized audit committee have set up mechanisms to review internal and external audit matters as well as progress made in implementing audit recommendations. In some of these cases, it is the relevant programme and budget committee that plays this role. 17. When considering the role of the audit committees within an organization, it is important to recognize the distinction between the committees that operate as advisory panels to either the respective executive heads or the executive boards and those that are part of the governing body of the organization. The latter is the case in most of the multinational financial institutions like the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 18. The responsibilities of the oversight committees generally include: (a) Reviewing the strategy and workplans of internal and, in some organizations, external audit; and discussing the scope and content of their audits so as to identify audit priorities and suggesting potential audit areas within which to address the organization's risks; (b) Reviewing the findings and recommendations emanating from the reports, inspection and investigations, including those on irregularities and fraud; (c) Ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken by the management in implementing the recommendations of the internal and external oversight bodies and monitoring follow-up action thereon. 19. In addition, other responsibilities of some of the committees include: (a) Assessing the integrity of the financial statements of the organizations and their accounting, financial reporting and disclosure policies and practices; (b) Reviewing risk management and the internal control system; (c) Making recommendations with regard to the appointments and tenure of members of the external board of auditors; (d) Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of internal and external audit services; (e) Providing an open avenue of communication between the governing board, management and the functions of internal and external audit; (f) Serving as an issue resolution forum in cases where there are differences in respect of opinions or recommendations between managers and auditors or investigators, or among the auditors themselves; (g) Promoting an organization-wide culture that accepts the importance and value of the internal audit, inspection and investigation functions and providing 9 A/60/312 executive heads with the assurance that these functions are operating effectively and efficiently. Composition 20. In general, the membership of the committees ranges from six to nine members, primarily high-ranking or senior management officers. However, external (United Nations or non-United Nations) members are strategically included either because of their present position as is the case at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or because of their professional qualifications, expertise and/or competence as is the case at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). External members usually serve for a two-year renewable term. Meetings 21. The committees generally meet up to four times per annum. However the chairperson in most cases possesses the discretionary authority to call additional meetings if deemed appropriate, for example, to initiate discussion of emerging audit matters. The executive head in some instances can also request that the chairperson convene a meeting. Reporting 22. The committees generally report to either the executive head or to the governing body (for example, the executive council). It is worth noting that the committees within the United Nations system generally report to their executive heads, while the committees within the multinational financial institutions and other international organizations report to their executive boards. IV. Strengthening of the oversight mechanisms 23. Independent oversight is an essential part of any comprehensive system of accountability. At the United Nations, there are three main bodies that provide this function, namely, the Board of Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU. Without the audit of financial statements, the investigation of complaints, the evaluation of programme performance, and all the other reviews carried out by these bodies, both internal management and the governing bodies would not have an impartial assessment of the functioning of the Organization or, where shortcomings are identified, be in a position to hold accountable those responsible. It is therefore essential that the oversight bodies be independent, have the capacity to carry out their functions, and provide full coverage of all aspects of the functioning of the Organization. It is also essential that effective follow-up action be taken on the basis of their findings, including implementation of recommendations and analysis of their reports, to address systemic weaknesses. The measures described in the present section of this report address these issues. 10 A/60/312 A. Establishment of the United Nations Oversight Committee 24. As has been described in section III of this report, the Secretariat initiated a review of audit committees in order to establish a similar body at the United Nations. Pursuant to the initiation of this review, the General Assembly, in resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, requested the establishment of a high-level follow-up mechanism under the authority of the Secretary-General to effectively feed findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive management processes. 25. Utilizing the findings of the Secretariat's review, terms of reference for a United Nations Oversight Committee have been prepared and are ready for issuance. The Oversight Committee will function as an independent advisory panel to the Secretary-General. Its objectives include ensuring the systematic implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies; sharing audit-related information and lessons learned within the Secretariat, where appropriate; and ensuring that significant risks to the Organization are identified and mitigating measures taken. Its responsibilities will include: (a) Ensuring that appropriate and timely action is taken by the relevant managers to rectify problems in areas of concern identified by oversight bodies, and to effectively manage risks within the organization; (b) Alerting the Secretary-General on systemic organizational issues that may arise from audit, investigation or evaluation reports, and making recommendations as appropriate; (c) On behalf of the Secretary-General, providing advice and suggestions on the priorities, long-term strategy and annual audit workplans of oversight bodies and requesting that significant risks identified be included in such workplans; (d) Preparing the Secretary-General's response to reports of oversight bodies submitted to the General Assembly, taking into account the input provided by the departments or offices concerned; (e) Rendering advice on audit related-matters to the Secretary-General and departmental heads as it deems appropriate; (f) Encouraging and facilitating, if necessary, collaboration and cooperation among the various oversight bodies. 26. The Secretary-General will appoint a Chairperson and three additional members to the Committee. The Chairperson and two of the members will be senior Secretariat officials at a rank no lower than that of Assistant Secretary-General. The other member will be external to the Secretariat. Members of the Committee shall serve for a period of two years, renewable once, with the renewal period phased so as to provide continuity. Committee members shall act in an independent capacity while performing their advisory role on the Committee. The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairperson or any member as required but no less than once every calendar quarter. The Under-Secretary-General for Management will attend meetings in an ex officio capacity. 27. The Committee is required to produce an annual report on its work for the previous year, which will be presented to the Secretary-General during the first calendar quarter of each year. The Committee will also contribute to the annual 11 A/60/312 report to the General Assembly on measures taken to improve accountability in the Secretariat. 28. It should be noted that some of the functions identified during the review of the audit committees of other organizations have not been included in the terms of reference  of  the  Oversight  Committee.  These  would  include  making recommendations on the resource requirements of the various oversight bodies; assessment of the efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and JIU to strengthen the Organization's internal controls; and the identification of possible gaps in the United Nations oversight coverage. It is considered that these functions would not be appropriately discharged by a committee reporting directly to the Secretary-General. However, additional strengthening of United Nations oversight is currently under discussion in the General Assembly. B. Enhancement of fraud and corruption prevention mechanisms 29. In paragraph 349 of volume I of the report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5 (vol. I), chap. I), the Board recommended, inter alia, that the Administration: (a) Implement a comprehensive and well-communicated corruption and fraud prevention plan in the United Nations system; (b) Establish a corruption and fraud prevention committee that would serve as an effective framework and coordination point for a United Nations system corruption and fraud prevention mechanism; (c) Conduct ethics, corruption and fraud awareness training sessions and workshops among managers, international and local employees and other stakeholders; (d) Develop appropriate resolution mechanisms for reported and detected incidents and allegations of corruption and fraud. A clarification was obtained from the Board that the word ""system"" mentioned in its recommendation referred to the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 30. The United Nations already has in place many rules, procedures and controls designed to prevent fraud and corruption. However, based on the Board's recommendation, new efforts have been initiated to draw a more comprehensive plan, addressing all aspects of corruption and fraud prevention. To that end, a working group has been established to propose such a plan. As a first step, the working group is drawing up an anti-corruption and fraud prevention policy which will draw on existing best practices, including the model recently developed by the World Bank. 31. The working group will also propose an effective mechanism through which to coordinate the efforts on corruption and fraud prevention of the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 32. A training programme will be part of the overall corruption and fraud prevention plan. It will include general awareness training, as well as specific modules for functions where the risk of fraud and corruption is higher. The programme will address staff at all levels of the Organization. 12 A/60/312 C. Efforts to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services 33. The Office of Internal Oversight Services in its tenth annual report to the General Assembly (see A/59/359) provided the results of its own self-evaluation to assist the Assembly in carrying out its review and evaluation of the Office in 2004. The self-evaluation exercise looked at strengths and weaknesses and pointed to areas where the Office could be improved. In addition, in his note transmitting the annual report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General recommended to the Assembly that the Office undergo a comprehensive external review in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out all aspects of its work. That recommendation was reiterated in paragraph 192 of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all"" (A/59/2005). 34. The General Assembly in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/272 affirmed that any external review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services could be undertaken only by such bodies as the Board of Auditors or JIU, or those mandated to do so by the Assembly. It is recommended that the scope of such a review should include the investigation processes at offices away from Headquarters as recommended by the Board. 35. Apart from any external review that may be undertaken as a result of the Secretary-General's proposals above, measures have already been taken to strengthen the investigation function of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In resolution 59/287 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly re-emphasized that the Office was the internal body entrusted with investigation in the United Nations and therefore decided that the results of all preliminary investigations conducted by programme managers should be reported to the Office. Pursuant to the adoption of this resolution, the Office now has independent, residual and exclusive authority to investigate the most serious cases (all ""category one"" cases, that is to say, all high- risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases). An added layer of oversight determines that the Office must be informed of the results of all ""category two"" cases (cases of lower risk to the Organization) investigated by programme managers, so that the Office can have an overview of all matters that have been investigated by the Organization. D. Review of governance structures and the format of accountability reports 36. The way in which financial reports and reports of oversight bodies are considered and acted upon represents an essential part of the accountability process. Recognizing this, the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 57/278 A of 20 December 2002 (later reaffirmed in resolution 59/264 A) requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to examine governance structures, principles and accountability throughout the United Nations system and to make proposals on the future format and consideration of the reports of the Board of Auditors by the respective executive boards and the Assembly. The matter was taken up and discussed by the High-level Committee on Management (HLCM) at its eighth session, held in Rome on 5 and 6 October 2004. At that session, the Committee decided that, in the first instance, this item should be carried forward by the Finance and Budget Network, in particular as regards format and consideration of the reports of the Board of 13 A/60/312 Auditors, and requested that the secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) carry out consultations with the Board of Auditors and obtain more detailed information on the scope and objectives of this review (see CEB/2004/6, para. 60). Member States are currently seized with the subject of strengthening governance arrangements in the context of the discussions on the outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly. 37. Related to this subject is the recommendation of the Board of Auditors that covered the issue of governance principles and best practices related to financial reporting. It pointed out that in its view, the following governance issues were normally reported on in a medium such as the financial report that preceded the financial statements: (a) governance and other regulatory bodies; (b) performance reporting and non-financial information; (c) social accounting issues; and (d) risk management, continuity and internal control (A/59/5/Add.2, chap. II, para. 25). 38. At its ninth session held at Geneva in April 2005, the High-level Committee on Management decided to set up a working group to examine current accountability mechanisms in organizations, to raise awareness of such tools and to identify best practices (see CEB/2005/3, para. 22 (f)). It was recognized that this issue was very broad and was related to overall organizational culture and not just audit processes (ibid., para. 21). Therefore, the working group will comprise representatives of budget, finance and human resources management. The terms of reference of this working group will, inter alia, include addressing the resolutions and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above. V. Ensuring ethical conduct 39. The commitment to the highest ethical standards at the United Nations is a core value and fundamental guiding principle in ensuring that the Organization achieves its mission. In response to the findings of a Secretariat-wide staff survey, the probes into the management of the oil-for-food programme and the allegations of sexual misconduct in various peace missions, the United Nations has begun implementing additional measures to address deficiencies and ensure a culture of ethical conduct. A. Proposed establishment of the United Nations Office of Ethics 40. Underlying the main effort of the Secretariat in that regard is the proposal for the establishment of an independent Office of Ethics, the head of which will report directly to the Secretary-General. The objective of the Office will be to assist the Organization in maintaining the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter of the United Nations and thereby maintain and enhance international confidence in the United Nations through fostering a culture of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability, setting and disseminating standards for appropriate professional conduct and providing leadership, management and oversight of the United Nations ethics infrastructure. Proposals for the establishment of the Office of Ethics, along with its terms of reference, are currently under preparation for the consideration of the General Assembly. 14 A/60/312 B. Financial disclosure by senior officials 41. In July 2005, the Secretary-General decided to broaden the scope of financial disclosure, as currently required of senior officials, including those employed on a short-term basis or under special conditions. This followed a review of disclosure practices in comparable organizations. The appropriate mechanisms for monitoring these disclosures are also under review for immediate strengthening. It is envisaged that the scope of annual financial disclosure and declaration of interest will be broadened from the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General level to include all staff at the D-1 level and above. The financial disclosure threshold levels will be lowered for assets and income from $25,000 to $10,000 and for gifts from $10,000 to $250. 42. The financial disclosure programme will be administered by the proposed Office of Ethics, pursuant to its establishment. The implementation of the expanded financial disclosure regime will require an amendment of staff regulation 1.2 (n) by the General Assembly. C. Protection against retaliation for exposure of wrongdoing or reporting of irregularities and misconduct 43. The Secretary-General is finalizing a comprehensive policy to ensure protection against retaliation for reporting of alleged misconduct. This policy will complement existing administrative issuances concerning avenues for the reporting of alleged misconduct that are set out in information circular ST/IC/2005/19. It is essential that staff have confidence in these mechanisms and assurance that the appropriate level of protection is provided. For this reason, additional rounds of consultation with the staff have been conducted on the terms of the new policy. D. Enhancement of codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest rules 44. While the United Nations has in place a detailed Code of Conduct readily available to all staff on the Intranet, it is now planned to disseminate the Code in other ways. The Secretary-General has commissioned the design of a user-friendly orientation and information booklet for distribution in the latter part of 2005 to all staff based on the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members (ST/SGB/2002/13). Special additional rules are also being developed for staff engaged in procurement activities. In this respect, a Declaration of Independence to be signed by all staff members working in the procurement process has been prepared and an administrative issuance on rules governing the conduct of staff engaged in procurement activities is being finalized for adoption by the Secretary-General. A United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct is also being formulated. It is expected that all these materials will be produced and ready for dissemination in the near future. 45. The Office of Ethics, once established, will be responsible for standard-setting on ethics issues and training, in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management. 15 A/60/312 E. Incorporation of ethics into staff training programmes 46. Staff will be required to complete a new downloadable content module on integrity and ethics provisions for self-training that has now been completed in the form of a CD-ROM. In addition, ethics modules have been incorporated into all existing training programmes for United Nations staff, including at induction, and the Career Resources Centre (CRC) offers a lunchtime programme on ethics. It is envisaged that both the CD-ROM on integrity and the Career Resources Centre ethics programme will be mandatory for all staff. F. Protection against harassment in the workplace 47. While the United Nations has a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy in place, the Secretary-General is in the process of formulating a new, broader policy to encompass other forms of harassment. This will be introduced following consultation with the staff representative bodies. The United Nations Secretariat has also joined the United Nations Development Group in the development and implementation of an online learning programme on harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, which, once available, will be mandatory for all staff. G. Response to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by field personnel 48. In addition to the efforts in place for dealing with the issues of harassment and sexual misconduct, in response to the widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse at some United Nations peacekeeping operations, there has been aggressive pursuit by the Organization of such cases. As of July 2005, across all peacekeeping operations, 186 peacekeepers had been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse; 7 United Nations civilians had been summarily dismissed; and 80 members of military contingents had been expelled from the field missions. Investigations into such allegations are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Haiti in particular. Additionally, a number of short- and medium-term initiatives are under way, including: (a) The introduction of a unified standard of conduct across all categories of peacekeeping personnel. Mandatory training on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse has been integrated into all mission induction programmes. Improved complaint mechanisms have been established in all missions, including telephone hotlines and a network of Focal Points for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, who receive complaints in person. In addition, missions are ensuring that victims of sexual abuse are referred to existing emergency assistance (medical, psychosocial, legal) in the mission area; (b) A global review of the state of discipline in peacekeeping operations conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the results of which are currently being analysed; (c) The establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. Over the coming months, similar capacity will be created in eight Department of Peacekeeping 16 A/60/312 Operations missions. The Units will focus on preventing misconduct through various means, including awareness-raising and training and improving welfare and recreation facilities. Other key activities of such Units will include tracking data on misconduct cases for all categories of peacekeeping personnel and developing measures to ensure compliance with United Nations standards of conduct, such as the establishment of lists of premises considered out of bounds for United Nations personnel. Such Units will work with in-country networks on sexual exploitation and abuse, developed to better coordinate and share information on this problem; (d) The approval by the General Assembly in June 2005 of 19 new Office of Internal Oversight Services investigator positions, as well as additional investigative resources for following up allegations of misconduct in peacekeeping missions. 49. In the longer term, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the welfare and recreation needs of all peacekeeping personnel, as well as the development of a comprehensive strategy for victim assistance. New agreements with troop- contributing countries and United Nations partners will be developed. In addition, a group of legal experts will be examining ways to ensure that United Nations staff and experts on mission are held responsible for criminal acts committed in countries where no functioning judicial system exists. H. Dissemination of information concerning the Secretary-General's decisions in disciplinary matters 50. Starting  in  2002,  two  information  circulars  (ST/IC/2002/25  and ST/IC/2004/28) were issued that informed all staff of the Secretary-General's practice in disciplinary matters. It is expected that the sharing of information with staff members concerning decisions on disciplinary cases will not only raise awareness and enhance transparency in disciplinary matters, but also have a deterrent effect and thus enhance ethical conduct. VI. Enhancing transparency 51. Transparency is an essential feature of any system of accountability. By making decision-making processes, performance data, transaction processing, and general information about the Organization more accessible, the United Nations becomes more accountable to Member States, staff and civil society. A major vehicle for improving transparency has been Internet technology, and the United Nations home page has been enhanced during the last few years to become a strategic communication tool. Efforts are also ongoing to increase awareness inside the United Nations of Intranet capabilities, and build on existing features, such as the Procurement and Facilities Management tracking systems, that give transparency to administrative processes. In addition to the continuous expansion of the Intranet, Extranet and Internet, there are other measures aimed at improving the openness of the operation of the United Nations, which are described below. 17 A/60/312 A. Access to United Nations information 52. The Secretary-General has initiated an assessment of best practices in public administrations around the world and examined various models of information access in different countries in developing a clear and consistent policy for determining which United Nations documents should be accessible outside the Secretariat. In the latter part of 2005, the Management Committee will review this comprehensive assessment and will provide guidance for a new policy. It should be noted that access to United Nations documentation that is neither restricted nor confidential is now freely available on the Internet through the Official Document System. B. Selection and appointment of senior officials 53. In order to enhance transparency in the appointment of senior officials, the Secretary-General has put in place a new selection process which ensures a much wider search for qualified candidates and allows for a rigorous, open process against predetermined criteria for all senior United Nations officials and heads of United Nations funds and programmes. As part of the new mechanism, the Senior Appointment Group (SAG) reviews candidatures for appointment by the Secretary- General. The Chef de Cabinet then constitutes an interview panel with a minimum of four members of the Group. The names of two or more finalists are then submitted to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for final consideration. 54. In the case of senior appointments that involve intergovernmental bodies in the appointment process (for example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of Internal Oversight Services), shortlists are drawn up from a list of nominations submitted in response to a request for such nomination by the Secretary-General addressed to Members States and relevant institutions. Shortlists would also be developed through a more informal process of outreach and search. In the case of Secretariat appointments of a specialized nature, an outside technical expert may be invited to be part of the relevant interview panel. In all cases, clear job descriptions and required competencies will have been developed against which candidates can be judged. A more systematic process of vetting and reference-checking of candidates will be instituted, with external assistance whenever necessary. The Secretary-General will in all cases have the ultimate authority to make the final selection, taking into account other factors, such as geographical distribution and gender balance. Since the establishment of this new procedure, several senior-level posts have been filled via the new system, including those of UNDP, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and UNHCR. C. Senior Review Group 55. The Secretary-General has constituted a Senior Review Group as a standing advisory body to make recommendations to the Secretary-General on appointment and promotion to posts at the D-2 level. For the purpose of defining the terms of 18 A/60/312 reference of the Group, Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/4 was promulgated on 28 February 2005 and the membership of the Group was presented in information circular ST/IC/2005/33 of 1 July 2005. In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin, all appointments to this body are made by the Secretary-General. According to section 3, all D-2 vacancy announcements, except for vacant posts in the Executive Office of the Secretary- General and for the special envoys, are to be circulated. D. External validation of the procurement system 56. The Volcker Inquiry was critical of various United Nations procurement cases in the early years of the oil-for-food programme. However, since the mid-1990s, a major overhaul of the United Nations procurement process has been undertaken, making it more transparent and addressing any shortcomings identified in a number of different reviews. In the light of issues raised by the Volcker Inquiry, the Secretary-General commissioned a review, completed in June 2005, that compared existing procurement rules and regulations with the best global practices of outside organizations and companies in order to ensure that the improvements introduced since the mid to late 1990s met the highest global standards. In addition, in August 2005, the Secretary-General commissioned a full financial and internal control review of the United Nations current procurement system. 57. The June 2005 review evaluated positively the transparency achieved by the United Nations Procurement Service website. The review stated that the Service website (http://www.un.org/Depts/ptd) was an extensive, well-designed site with current information directly relevant to the needs of prospective and active suppliers and that the transparent and open approach of the Service to sourcing and vendor development was directly in line with that of leading public procurement agencies. E. Accounting standards 58. The adoption of clear standards for accounting purposes is essential for transparent financial reporting. The High Level Committee on Management has approved a project for the development of such accounting standards within the United Nations system. This project is being undertaken by a Task Force under the auspices of the Committee's Finance and Budget Network. Possible standards have been identified and final proposals will be submitted by the Task Force to the Finance and Budget Network for approval prior to their presentation to the Committee for endorsement. VII. Time frames for implementation of the recommendations of the oversight bodies 59. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/264 A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to indicate expected time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, including the office-holders to be held accountable. A similar request was later reiterated in paragraph 6 of resolution 264 B; and in paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the Secretary-General 19 A/60/312 was further requested to provide an assessment to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of recommendations of the Board. 60. As per annex III of the present report, approximately 73 per cent of the recommendations addressed to the United Nations, and reported as outstanding to the Board of Auditors as at the end of June 2004, had time frames assigned for implementation. For the United Nations University (UNU), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, time frames were provided in 82 per cent, 50 per cent, 40 per cent and 47 per cent of cases, respectively. For all four organizations, the office-holders responsible for implementation were clearly identified for all outstanding recommendations. The progress towards proper assignment of time frames was acknowledged by the Board in paragraph 1 (a) of its current report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the status of implementation of its recommendations relating to the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex). 61. Owing to the high priority given to the implementation of all the approved recommendations of the Board of Auditors and the other oversight bodies, efforts have been intensified by the Secretariat to ensure that the recommendations of the other oversight bodies, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU also have responsible  office-holders  assigned  and  time  frames  defined  for  their implementation. The Oversight Committee will have an overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with these requirements. 62. Overall progress is being made towards improving implementation rates. The Board of Auditors was pleased to note that the overall proportion of implementation of 34 per cent of the previous biennium had increased to 46 per cent in the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex, para. 9). VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 63. This report describes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to strengthen the system of accountability at the United Nations. In formulating these measures, the Secretary-General has taken into account the need for: (a) the clear definition of authority and results to be achieved; (b) the establishment of appropriate support and guidance mechanisms; (c) the strengthening of systems to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of performance; and (d) the provision of follow-up mechanisms that lead to appropriate recognition of both good and unsatisfactory performance, and investigations and appropriate corrective action if necessary. 64. Many of the measures described, such as the establishment of the Management Performance Board and the proposed establishment of the Office of Ethics, will themselves lead to a further examination of the way that the United Nations 20 A/60/312 conducts its business and to additional measures to improve the system of accountability. Together with those already described in this report, they will help achieve the goal of ensuring that programme managers and staff are held accountable for the effective delivery of their work and the way they conduct themselves, and that both management and staff operate in an open and transparent environment, free from unethical conduct. 65. The General Assembly may wish to take note of this report, including of the fact that new elements are being added to the accountability framework that will strengthen accountability in the Secretariat. 21 A/60/312 Annex I The accountability framework Responsibility and authority Accountability Mechanism       Charter of the United Nations General Assembly and other intergovernmental bodies Provide mandates and overall policy guidance to the Secretary-General for the execution of these mandates as well as those given to the Secretary-General directly by the Charter of the United Nations.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/IC/2006/30       Secretariat      16 August 2006       06-47198 (E)    210806      *0647198*  Information circular*      To: Members of the staff      From: The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management      Subject: Outside activities      1.  The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members of the  Organization's procedures relating to outside activities, which are set out in  administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13.        Outside occupation or employment    2.  The basic rule is that staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation  or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary- General.  3.  The first requirement for approval is that there be no conflict with the staff  member's official functions or status as an international civil servant. The outside  occupation or employment should not interfere with the staff member's ability to  perform his or her duties or call into question his or her impartiality and  independence as an international civil servant.   4.  The second requirement is that the outside activity not be against the interest  of the United Nations as, for example, working with an organization whose goals  are incompatible with those of the United Nations or working in a capacity that  would call into question the staff member's impartiality or independence.  5.  The third requirement is that the outside occupation or employment be  permitted by local law at the duty station or where the occupation or employment  occurs.  6.  Staff members authorized to engage in outside activities shall make clear to  the organizers and participants in such activities, including any employers,  that they  act in their personal capacity and not as representatives of the United Nations.          Activities related to the United Nations    7.  Unless they form part of the normal course of official duties, prior  authorization is required for staff members to engage in any of the following acts, if  they relate to the purpose, activities or interests of the United Nations:        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2006/30      06-47198  2      (a)  Issuance of statements to the press, radio or other agencies of public  information;    (b)  Acceptance of speaking engagements;    (c)  Taking part in film, theatre, radio or television productions;    (d)  Submitting articles, books or other material for publication.  8.  Outside activities that are of benefit to the Organization or the achievement of  its goals and/or contribute to the development of professional skills of staff  members are usually not only permitted but encouraged.         Other outside activities          Social or charitable activities and pursuit of studies    9.  Private non-remunerated activities for social or charitable purposes not related  to the staff member's official functions or to the United Nations and pursuit of  studies may be engaged in at the staff member's discretion as long as those activities  take place outside of working hours or while the staff member is on leave.        Political activities    10. Staff members may exercise the right to vote.  Staff members should ensure  that their participation in political activities does not reflect adversely upon their  status as independent and impartial international civil servants. Staff members  cannot thus be candidates for political office. Membership in a political party is  permitted, provided it does not entail action or obligation to action that would  reflect adversely on their status as international civil servants. In case of doubt as to  whether the activity is permitted, enquiries may be made by the staff member  concerned, as indicated in paragraphs 12 and 13 below.        Participation in boards, panels, committees, expert groups and similar bodies    11. Participation in boards, panels, committees, expert groups or similar bodies  that are external to the Organization constitutes an outside activity that requires the  prior approval of the Secretary-General. If, after approval has been granted, it  appears that the staff member's participation would involve the consideration of the  granting of an honour, gift or remuneration to a United Nations official, the staff  member should withdraw from the body concerned since his or her participation  would create at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.        Clarification procedures    12. Sections 6.1 to 6.5 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13 set out  procedures whereby a staff member may seek in confidence clarification as to  whether a planned outside occupation, employment or activity would conflict with  his or her status as an international civil servant.  13. Staff members are also reminded that the Ethics Office, which was established  to assist the Secretary-General in ensuring that all staff members observe and  perform their functions consistent with the highest standards of integrity  required  by the Charter of the United Nations, provides confidential advice and guidance to  staff on ethical issues, including conflict of interest.    ST/IC/2006/30   3  06-47198        Approval procedures    14. Sections 6.6 to 6.9 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13 set out the  procedures to be followed by a staff member wishing to engage in an outside  activity for which prior approval is required under sections 3 and 4 of the  instruction.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2021/4      Secretariat      13 August 2021      21-11428 (E)    270821  *2111428*         Administrative instruction         Performance Management and Development System        The Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance,  pursuant to section 4.2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin on procedures for the  promulgation of administrative issuances (ST/SGB/2009/4), and for the purpose of  updating the policies and procedures for performance management and development,  pursuant to staff rule 1.3, promulgates the following:         Section 1      Scope of application      All staff members who hold appointments of at least one year (except for staff  at the levels of Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General, staff  members who sign a senior manager's compact with the Secretary-General and staff  performing the functions of Resident Coordinator) shall have their performance  evaluated in accordance with the Performance Management and Development  System. The present instruction does not apply to staff members holding temporary  appointments, who may be evaluated under the provisions of the administrative  instruction on administration of temporary appointments (ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1).         Section 2      Purpose, roles and responsibilities    2.1 The key goals of the Performance Management and Development System are to  establish a framework that allows for the fair and equitable evaluation of the  performance of staff members and to foster a culture of regular feedback.   2.2 Staff members, including first and second reporting officers, have a duty to fulfil  their obligations and to be active participants in the development and assessment  processes, was well as to fully comply with the procedures established herein. Heads  of entity1 have a duty to ensure that staff members fully comply with the obligation  under staff rule 1.3 (c).   __________________    1  For the purposes of the present instruction, the term ""entity"" means a department or an office,  including an office away from Headquarters, a special political or peacekeeping mission, a  regional commission, a resident or regional coordinator office or any other unit tasked with  programmed activities.  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  2/13    2.3 The purpose of the Performance Management and Development System is also  to improve the delivery of programmes by optimizing individual performance at all  levels, which it will achieve by:    (a)  Promoting a culture of accountability and adherence to United Nations  standards of conduct;    (b)  Promoting a culture of high performance, personal and professional  development and continuous learning;    (c)  Empowering managers and holding them responsible and accountable for  managing their staff;    (d)  Encouraging a high level of staff participation in the planning, delivery  and evaluation of work;     (e)  Recognizing successful performance and addressing underperformance  fairly and equitably.  2.4 The function of the Performance Management and Development System is to  promote communication between staff members and supervisors throughout the  performance management and development cycle, including on the goals and key  results to be achieved and the success criteria by which individual performance will  be assessed. The System enables a culture that promotes continuous learning and  personal and professional development, recognizes successful performance and  addresses performance shortcomings.   2.5 The Performance Management and Development System is supported by an  electronic application that captures the main stages of the performance process,  namely the workplan and the end-of-cycle performance review. The application also  acts as a reporting tool that provides key metrics in support of the performance  management and development cycle.         Section 3      Performance management and development cycle    3.1 The performance management and development cycle should normally be  12 months, beginning on 1 April of each year and ending on 31 March of the  following year. However, as provided in sections 3.2 and 3.3, the performance period  may be shorter or longer than the 12-month cycle, normally no less than 6 months or  longer than 18 months.  3.2 When a staff member takes up new duties upon recruitment, transfer or  assignment in the course of the cycle, an individual workplan should normally be  established within the first two months of assumption of the new functions. If a staff  member actively serves with a Secretariat entity for less than six months during the  cycle, no performance document is required to be completed.   3.3 Upon a staff member's separation from service, or when a staff member takes  up new duties upon reassignment or transfer, the performance document shall be  completed by the staff member and his or her supervisor for the period between the  beginning of the performance period and the date of reassignment, transfer or  separation. If the staff member performs the same functions but serves under  successive supervisors during the year, the supervisor of the staff member at the time  at which the cycle ends shall complete the end-of-cycle evaluation, and prior  supervisors should be consulted or, if applicable, act as additional supervisors for the  relevant workplan goals.  3.4 To ensure the timely completion of the performance document, if supervisors  separate from the United Nations, it is their responsibility to complete the    ST/AI/2021/4    3/13  21-11428    Performance Management and Development System duties required of them before  the date of separation. Separation procedures and processing of final entitlements of  supervisors may be delayed until any duties relating to the evaluations for which they  are responsible are completed.        Section 4      Staff members    4.1 All staff members shall fulfil their responsibilities under the Performance  Management and Development System. Staff members are responsible for:    (a)  Understanding the larger organizational goals;    (b)  Soliciting clarification on individual performance expectations;    (c)  Participating in a dialogue with the first reporting officer to facilitate the  development and finalization of the individual workplan and maintaining milestone  discussions during the reporting period. Milestone discussions occur at a frequency  agreed upon at the start of the cycle and are recorded by the first reporting officer;    (d)  Participating in performance conversations with the first reporting officer  on recognition of good performance, identifying areas for further development and  addressing shortcomings, if any, at the time at which they arise. Performance  conversations occur outside the regular intervals set initially for milestone  discussions and are not necessarily recorded;    (e)  Taking steps to complete each stage of the process for which they are  responsible without delay;    (f)  Accepting or declining the invitation to participate in multi-rater, or ""360- degree"", feedback evaluations in accordance with section 8.4, if invited to do so.  4.2 Non-compliance with the terms of the present instruction by a staff member  should be recorded in the individual performance document and reflected in the  overall rating. The staff member prepares and uploads the workplan. Any  disagreement between the staff member and the first reporting officer may be resolved  with the second reporting officer in accordance with section 5.4. If the staff member  does not take the required action in time to submit a workplan for the cycle, the first  reporting officer may upload a final workplan to the system.        Section 5      Reporting officers and additional supervisors    5.1 A first reporting officer shall be designated for each staff member at the  beginning of the performance management and development cycle. The first reporting  officer is responsible for:    (a)  Developing the workplan with the staff member, incorporating appropriate  competencies into the workplan and emphasizing core values in support of the  performance management process;    (b)  Conducting milestone discussions at a frequency agreed upon at the start  of the cycle, and recognizing good performance and any shortcomings as they become  apparent at any time during the cycle, as appropriate, in performance conversations  outside the regular intervals set initially for the milestone discussions;     (c)  Conducting and recording the final evaluation;    (d)  Advising, supporting and coaching the staff member on professional  development and in the development of a personal and professional development  plan;  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  4/13      (e)  Developing a performance improvement plan in consultation with the staff  member in the case of performance shortcomings or underperformance, if applicable;    (f)  Ensuring that the performance documents of their supervisees are  completed in accordance with the prescribed procedures.  5.2 The first reporting officer should normally be the supervisor of the staff member.  However, under exceptional circumstances, heads of entity may approve, when  warranted, a first reporting officer who is not the staff member's supervisor, but who  is in a position to fulfil the roles and responsibilities of a first reporting officer as  outlined in the present instruction.   5.3 Up to two additional supervisors may be designated when a staff member works  for more than one supervisor more than 25 per cent of the time or on assignments of  at least 30 working days, provided that such arrangements are put into place with the  agreement of the first reporting officer at the work planning stage, at the beginning  of the additional assignment or when the staff member's supervisor changes during  the cycle.  5.4 The second reporting officer, who should normally be the first reporting  officer's supervisor or the equivalent, is responsible for:    (a)  Ensuring that the first reporting officer understands and applies the  principles and procedures of the Performance Management and Development System;    (b)  Holding the first reporting officer accountable for developing, in a timely  manner, together with their staff, workplans with fair, realistic and consistent  performance expectations and ensuring linkages between the priorities of the entity  and the work unit with the individual workplans;    (c)  Holding the first reporting officer accountable for the timely completion  of the staff member's end-of-cycle evaluation;    (d)  Providing regular feedback on and evaluating the first reporting officer's  ability to manage and support the performance of his or her supervisees;    (e)  Resolving disagreements between the staff member and the first reporting  officer in the implementation of the Performance Management and Development  System;     (f)  Overseeing the establishment and implementation of a performance  improvement plan in case of performance shortcomings or underperformance, as  provided for in section 10 of the present instruction.  5.5 Second reporting officers also have the broader responsibility of ensuring that  the Performance Management and Development System is consistently and fairly  applied across work units by all first reporting officers who report to them. The second  reporting officer should ensure fairness and consistency throughout the cycle, in  particular when defining performance expectations and communicating performance  standards. The second reporting officer should ensure that:    (a)  There is consistency between the comments on and the overall rating of  individual staff members for a given performance management and development  cycle;    (b)  Ratings and comments given are factually sound, free of bias, constructive  and consistent;    (c)  Managers incorporate appropriate competencies into the workplan and  emphasize core values in support of the performance management process.    ST/AI/2021/4    5/13  21-11428    5.6 The second reporting officer shall oversee the multi-rater, or ""360-degree"",  feedback evaluations.  5.7 A staff member normally has one second reporting officer at any given time in  the reporting cycle. The first reporting officer and the second reporting officer should  not be the same person. However, under exceptional circumstances and after  consultation with the staff member, there may be only one reporting officer when it  is not possible to identify two different individuals to be the first and second reporting  officers.  5.8 Non-compliance with the terms of the present instruction by first or second  reporting officers should be recorded in their performance documents and be reflected  in their overall ratings. To this effect, their workplans should include a goal for timely  implementation of and compliance with the Performance Management and  Development System.         Section 6      Priorities of the entity, and work unit and individual plans     6.1 Before the beginning of the performance management and development cycle,  and for the purposes of strengthening accountability in the Secretariat, heads of entity  should sign a compact with the Secretary-General. Priorities of heads of entity are  translated into the workplans of work units in accordance with each entity's structure.  Work unit plans are developed in consultation with staff members concerned on an  annual basis, depending on the needs of the entity, and are regularly reviewed by the  first and second reporting officers to ensure that the plans remain relevant and  achievable. Heads of entity are responsible for ensuring that managers and staff fully  understand what is expected of them for the reporting period and how those individual  expectations fit into the wider mandates of the entity.        Individual plans    6.2 At the beginning of the cycle, supervisors should meet with the staff under their  direct supervision to ensure that the objectives of the work unit are understood and  that individual workplans are prepared. Supervisors may meet with their staff either  as a group or individually.   6.3 First reporting officers shall work with the staff members whom they supervise  on the development of the staff member's individual workplan for the cycle. The work  planning stage includes establishing individual performance evaluation criteria by  setting goals, key results and achievements, incorporating competencies into the  formulation of those goals, key results and achievements and formulating a personal  and professional development plan, as follows:     (a)  Workplan: upon the conclusion of the dialogue and agreement with the  first reporting officer, the staff member revises, if necessary, and submits the final  workplan to the first reporting officer. The format of the workplan may vary  depending on the functions of the staff member, but should include results-oriented  elements, such as goals, key results and achievements, actions to take to achieve each  goal, key result and achievement and measurement, through a statement of success  criteria, performance expectations and behavioural indicators, to evaluate  performance at the end of the cycle. When more than one staff member performs  similar functions, performance expectations may be collectively developed while  allowing for individual variations, where appropriate;    (b)  Competencies: the organizational competencies listed in the relevant  Secretary-General's bulletin on the subject (ST/SGB/1999/15) define a performance  standard against which all staff can be consistently and objectively evaluated. All staff  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  6/13    members are held accountable for demonstrating the core values. In their dialogue on  the workplan, the staff member and the first reporting officer shall list in the workplan  the most relevant competencies related to each of the goals, key results and  achievements identified for the reporting cycle and, where appropriate, the input from  the multi-rater, or ""360-degree"", feedback evaluations received during the prior cycle.  Specific job-related competencies may be added, where appropriate;    (c)  Personal and professional development plan: every staff member is  expected to complete a development plan. Staff members may indicate competencies  that they wish to strengthen and career aspirations for future assignments. Every staff  member is expected to set a minimum target of five days for professional development  per year in accordance with the Secretary-General's bulletin on the learning and  development policy (ST/SGB/2009/9).         Section 7      Performance conversations and milestone discussions    7.1 During the year, the first reporting officer and the staff member should have  ongoing performance conversations, whether verbally or in writing, which should be  used to acknowledge good performance and address any shortcomings.   7.2 The first reporting officer should conduct milestone discussions at regular  intervals agreed upon with the staff member. Such discussions should include  progress made and an explanation of any updates to the workplan goals, key results  and achievements. The first reporting officer should also note progress made in  demonstrating the competencies and in implementing the personal and professional  development plan. The staff member may note the progress made towards the goals  set in the workplan, the competencies and the personal and professional development  plan. Documentation of the milestone discussions is the responsibility of the first  reporting officer.         Section 8      End-of-cycle performance review    8.1 After the end of the performance management and development cycle, the first  reporting officer and the staff member shall meet, by electronic means if necessary,  to discuss the staff member's overall performance during the cycle. The meeting  should be held within three months after the end of the cycle.  8.2 Before the end-of-cycle evaluation between the first reporting officer and the  staff member, the staff member is encouraged to conduct an appraisal of the manner  in which he or she implemented the workplan defined at the beginning of the cycle.   8.3 The first reporting officer shall evaluate the extent to which the staff member  achieved the goals, key results and achievements set out in the workplan. The first  reporting officer shall also consider and comment on the manner in which the staff  member demonstrated the core values and competencies incorporated into the goals.  The first reporting officer may comment on the staff member's self-appraisal during  the evaluation of the staff member. First reporting officers are encouraged to discuss  the career aspirations of staff during the end-of-cycle review. An overall rating of the  staff member's performance shall be given by the first reporting officer pursuant to  section 9.   8.4 With regard to multi-rater, or ""360-degree"", feedback evaluation, staff with  managerial or supervisory responsibilities may be rated in the electronic 360-degree  application by the staff whom they supervise. Such evaluation will be progressively  rolled out and expanded to include feedback from peers and supervisors. The first    ST/AI/2021/4    7/13  21-11428    reporting officer shall take into account the 360-degree feedback, as well as input  from additional supervisors designated in accordance with section 5.2.  8.5 The second reporting officer shall review and endorse, as appropriate, the  evaluation of the first reporting officer, in accordance with his or her role as described  in sections 5.4 and 5.5. Should the second reporting officer have queries on or  concerns regarding the application of the Performance Management and Development  System, they should be discussed with the first reporting officer to ensure an overall  consistent performance document.   8.6 All parties should electronically sign or acknowledge the completed  performance document. The electronic signature of the staff member constitutes an  acknowledgement that the performance review has been conducted. It does not  indicate that the staff member is in agreement with the evaluation. The rebuttal  process outlined in section 15 cannot be initiated unless the staff member has signed  off on the finalized evaluation. A performance document submitted for electronic  signature to a staff member that the staff member does not sign is considered to be  signed by the staff member after 14 days of its receipt by the staff member. A staff  member who does not sign the performance document shall be so notified, and the  14-day period for submission of a rebuttal statement by the staff member, pursuant to  section 15.1, shall begin as of the date of such notification to the staff member.         Section 9      Rating system        Individual core values and competencies    9.1 Staff shall be appraised on the basis of the indicators that correspond to each of  the core values and competencies as incorporated into the goals, key results and  achievements. Such appraisal shall be taken into consideration in the determination  of the overall performance rating.  9.2 Evaluation of the level of demonstration of each of the core values and  competencies by the staff member during the performance management and  development cycle should be based on the degree to which the individual has been  observed as acting or behaving in accordance with the particular competency or value  and is a basis for staff development.        Overall performance rating    9.3 Staff may be given one of the following four overall ratings:    * Exceeds performance expectations    * Successfully meets performance expectations    * Partially meets performance expectations     * Does not meet performance expectations  9.4 A rating of ""exceeds performance expectations"" should be considered in cases  in which the staff member has surpassed the defined success criteria and/or  performance expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and achievements,  has continually gone beyond expectations or has significantly surpassed success  criteria and/or performance expectations in quantity and quality during the cycle,  including in demonstrating core values and competencies, as applicable.  9.5 A rating of ""successfully meets performance expectations"" should be considered  in cases in which the staff member has fully achieved the defined success criteria  and/or performance expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  8/13    achievements during the cycle, including in demonstrating core values and  competencies, as applicable.   9.6 The ratings of ""exceeds performance expectations"" and ""successfully meets  performance expectations"" establish full satisfaction with the work performed and  justify awarding a salary increment in accordance with section 16.3. The ratings shall  be so viewed when staff members are considered for selection for a position without  prejudice to the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General to appoint staff  members.   9.7 A rating of ""partially meets performance expectations"" should be considered if  the staff member did not meet the defined success criteria and/or performance  expectations for some of the goals, key results and achievements but demonstrates  potential for and a commitment to developing and applying the required skills.   9.8 A rating of ""does not meet performance expectations"" should be considered if  the staff member did not meet the defined success criteria or performance  expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and achievements and  demonstrates an inability to develop and apply the required skills or a lack of  commitment thereto.   9.9 A rating of ""partially meets performance expectations"" or ""does not meet  performance expectations"" indicates the existence of performance shortcomings.         Section 10      Identifying and addressing performance shortcomings and  unsatisfactory performance     10.1 During the performance cycle, the first reporting officer should continually  evaluate performance. When a performance shortcoming is identified during the  performance cycle, the first reporting officer, in consultation with the second  reporting officer, should proactively assist the staff member in remedying the  shortcoming. Remedial measures may include counselling, transfer to more suitable  functions, additional training and/or the institution of a time-bound performance  improvement plan, which should include clear targets for improvement and a  provision for coaching and supervision by the first reporting officer in conjunction  with performance conversations, which should be held on a regular basis.  10.2 If the performance shortcoming was not rectified following the remedial  measures indicated in section 10.1 and if, at the end of the performance cycle,  performance is appraised overall as ""partially meets performance expectations"", a  written performance improvement plan shall be prepared by the first reporting officer.  This shall be done in consultation with the staff member and the second reporting  officer. The performance improvement plan may cover up to a six-month period.  10.3 If the performance shortcoming was not rectified following the remedial  measures indicated in section 10.1, a number of administrative actions may ensue,  including the withholding of a within-grade salary increment pursuant to section 16.4,  the non-renewal of an appointment or the termination of an appointment for  unsatisfactory service in accordance with staff regulation 9.3.  10.4 If, at the end of the performance cycle, performance is appraised overall as ""does  not meet performance expectations"", the appointment may be terminated so long as  the remedial measures indicated in section 10.1 included a performance improvement  plan that was initiated no less than three months before the end of the performance  cycle.  10.5 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision for non-renewal  of a fixed-term appointment, and should the appointment expire before the end of the    ST/AI/2021/4    9/13  21-11428    period covering a performance improvement plan, the appointment should be renewed  for the duration necessary for the completion of the performance improvement plan.        Section 11      Implementation and monitoring by heads of entity    11.1 Heads of entity are responsible for the implementation of the Performance  Management and Development System.   11.2 Primary responsibility for the timely execution of, overall compliance with and  consistent and fair implementation of the Performance Management and  Development System rests with the head of entity, who should promote  communication between staff members and their supervisors, encourage regular  feedback through performance conversations and milestone discussions and ensure  that any change in the mandate or priorities of the entity is communicated to staff.   11.3 The head of entity is responsible for compliance with, and consistency and  fairness in the implementation (including ratings) of, the Performance Management  and Development System and the provision of other relevant data by no later than  30 June of each year. The executive office or local human resources office of each  entity should ensure that completed individual official records are maintained.   11.4 The head of entity shall hold all managers and supervisors accountable for the  effective use of the Performance Management and Development System throughout  all stages of the process and shall provide advice and recommendations, where  warranted. The head of entity should ensure that the entity's priorities are  communicated to all staff members of the entity. The head of entity may also establish  performance standards for the entity as the basis for individual success criteria.   11.5 One of the functions of the senior management team of each entity should be to  assist the head of entity in establishing a performance management and development  strategy for the entity and its implementation, as outlined in section 11.1.  11.6 At least once a year, the senior management team of each entity should devote  a meeting to performance management and development. At that meeting, the team  should review staff development and career support needs in the light of strategic  human resources management issues for the entity, including training and succession  management. The team may also provide guidance on recognition of successful  performance and on addressing performance shortcomings at the entity level.         Section 12      Joint Monitoring Group    12.1 A Joint Monitoring Group shall be established by each entity or by region or  duty station outside Headquarters. The members of the Group shall be appointed by  the head of entity. The Group shall normally consist of two members nominated by  management, two members nominated by the staff of the entity, in accordance with  local practice, and a Chair selected by the head of entity in consultation with the staff.  Each member shall serve for a two-year renewable term.  12.2 Each Joint Monitoring Group shall monitor and review the implementation of  the Performance Management and Development System by the entities concerned  with respect to the timeliness of the process and compliance with its purpose and  procedures, as provided in section 2. Joint Monitoring Groups shall work with the  respective entities to support the institutionalization of the Performance Management  and Development System. The Joint Monitoring Group may request from the heads  of entity statistical information necessary for the discharge of its functions. The Office  of Human Resources may provide ex officio support through the provision of such  information or the preparation of consolidated reports.   ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  10/13    12.3 The Joint Monitoring Group shall meet once a year, at the end of the  performance cycle. It shall report to the Global Joint Monitoring Group no later than  31 July of each year. Joint Monitoring Group reports shall include a compliance  review of the end-of-year appraisals and an overall summary of the Performance  Management and Development System implementation process in each entity for that  year.        Section 13      Global Joint Monitoring Group    13.1 The Global Joint Monitoring Group shall be a subsidiary body of the Staff- Management Coordination Committee. It shall be composed of two members  nominated by management, two nominated by the staff and a Chair appointed after  staff consultation by the President of the Staff-Management Coordination Committee.  Each member shall serve for a one-year renewable term.  13.2 The Global Joint Monitoring Group shall meet once a year, immediately prior  to the annual meeting of the Staff-Management Coordination Committee. It shall  examine policy issues related to the implementation of the Performance Management  and Development System across the Organization. It shall review the reports  submitted by Joint Monitoring Groups and shall prepare an annual report on the  implementation of the Performance Management and Development System in the  various entities. The report shall include recommendations regarding the  implementation and overall effectiveness of the Performance Management and  Development System and shall be submitted to the Staff-Management Coordination  Committee for transmittal to the Secretary-General.         Section 14      Rebuttal panels     14.1 In consultation with the staff representatives of the entities concerned, the head  of entity or his or her representative shall draw up a list of rebuttal panel members  composed of three groups of staff members from the entity concerned, in equal  numbers. The list shall be composed as follows:    (a)  Rebuttal panel members designated by the head of entity;    (b)  Rebuttal panel members designated by the staff representatives of the  entity in accordance with local practice;    (c)  Rebuttal panel Chairs selected by the head of entity after consultation with  the staff representatives of that entity.   The approved list, subdivided as indicated above, shall normally comprise nine  individuals for large entities and six for smaller entities. However, if an entity  determines that a larger membership pool is needed, it may expand the membership  by adding one or more members to each of the groups specified above. Every effort  shall be made to obtain an appropriate geographical and gender balance, where  possible. Members must have adequate knowledge and the experience required to  review the appraisal and its rating. The head of entity shall inform the staff in writing  of the composition of the approved list.  14.2 Rebuttal panel members shall serve for a two-year term. Should a member of  the rebuttal panel be assigned to functions outside the entity concerned, the panel  member shall be replaced in accordance with the procedure relevant to the group to  which the rebuttal panel member belongs.  14.3 If it is not possible to constitute a list from the staff members of that entity, the  approved list may include staff members of other entities at the same duty station,    ST/AI/2021/4    11/13  21-11428    provided that those staff members have the knowledge and experience required to  review the appraisal and its rating.        Section 15      Rebuttal process    15.1 Staff members who disagree with a ""partially meets performance expectations""  or a ""does not meet performance expectations"" rating received at the end of the  performance cycle may, within 14 days of signing the completed performance  document, submit to the relevant Executive Officer at Headquarters, or to the Chief  of Administration/Chief of Mission Support, as applicable, a written rebuttal  statement setting forth briefly the specific reasons that a higher overall rating should  have been received. Staff members who have received the rating of ""consistently  exceeds  performance  expectations""  or  ""successfully  meets  performance  expectations"" cannot initiate a rebuttal.  15.2 The rebuttal statement shall contain the names of the three individuals, one from  each of the three groups identified in section 14.1, whom the staff member has  selected to serve on the rebuttal panel, each of whose grade is equal to or higher than  that of the reporting officer whose evaluation or comments are being rebutted.   15.3 After receiving a copy of the rebuttal statement, the head of entity or his or her  representative shall, within 14 days, prepare and submit to the rebuttal panel a brief  written statement in reply to the rebuttal statement submitted by the staff member. A  copy of the reply to the rebuttal statement shall be given to the staff member. Unless  geographical location makes it impractical, the panel shall hear the staff member, the  first and second reporting officers and, at the discretion of the panel, other individuals  who may have information relevant to the review of the appraisal rating. Telephone  statements may also be taken where geographical separation so dictates.   15.4 The rebuttal panel shall prepare, within 14 days of the review of the case, a brief  report setting forth the reasons that the original rating should or should not be  maintained. In the event that an overall rating should not be maintained, the rebuttal  panel should designate the new rating on the performance evaluation. The report of  the rebuttal panel shall be placed in the staff member's official status file as an  attachment to the completed performance document.  15.5 The performance rating resulting from the rebuttal process shall be binding on  the head of entity and on the staff member concerned, subject to the ultimate authority  of the Secretary-General as Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization, who  may review the matter as needed on the basis of the record. Any change in the final  rating, as well as the date of the decision, shall be communicated to the Office of  Human Resources, with an annotation that the rating was changed as a result of a  review of the performance management and development rebuttal and including the  final rating recommended by the rebuttal panel.  15.6 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision of non-renewal of  an appointment, and should the appointment expire before the end of the rebuttal  process, the appointment should be renewed for the duration necessary for the  completion of the rebuttal process.  15.7 The rating resulting from an evaluation that has not been rebutted is final and  not subject to appeal. However, administrative decisions that stem from any final  performance appraisal and that affect the conditions of service of a staff member may  be resolved through informal or formal justice mechanisms.    ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  12/13        Section 16      Performance Management and Development System and salary increments    16.1 Under staff rule 3.3 (a), the granting of salary increments is subject to the  satisfactory performance and conduct of staff members as evaluated by their  supervisors, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary-General in any particular case.  The determination that service is satisfactory with respect to performance, as well as  the procedures for withholding a salary increment when such a determination cannot  be made, are governed by the provisions of the present section.  16.2 The decision to award or withhold a salary increment on the basis of  performance shall be made by the second reporting officer on the basis of the rating  awarded by the first reporting officer as reflected in the performance document.  16.3 The following ratings, as specified in section 9.3, shall justify a determination  that awarding a salary increment is warranted:    * Exceeds performance expectations     * Successfully meets performance expectations  16.4 The following ratings, as specified in section 9.3, shall justify a determination  that awarding a salary increment is not warranted:    * Partially meets performance expectations     * Does not meet performance expectations  16.5 When a salary increment is withheld owing to the rating ""partially meets  performance expectations"", the increment shall be withheld pending the outcome of  a performance improvement plan. If the staff member's performance improves  following the completion of the performance improvement plan, the staff member  shall be granted the salary increment with effect from the date of successful  completion of the performance improvement plan.  16.6 The decision to withhold a salary increment shall be communicated to the staff  member in writing before the decision is implemented, with a copy provided to the  Office of Human Resources or, in the case of offices away from Headquarters and  regional commissions, to the local human resources office.   16.7 Should the Performance Management and Development System rating on the  basis of which a salary increment has been withheld be upgraded at a later stage as a  result of the rebuttal process described in section 15, and should the new rating justify  the award of the salary increment, the increment shall be awarded and made effective  as from the date on which it would otherwise have been paid.         Section 17      Performance Management and Development System e-forms, learning  materials and guidelines    17.1 The Performance Management and Development System e-forms, learning  materials and guidelines are available to staff members on the intranet and through  their relevant executive office or local human resources office. They shall be updated  continually on the basis of best practices and evolving jurisprudence. Formal courses  should be provided at least every three years to update and consolidate staff  knowledge of the System. All entities should appoint performance management focal  points to provide assistance and guidance, as required.   17.2 The Performance Management and Development System learning materials and  guidelines are intended solely for general guidance and information. Should there be    ST/AI/2021/4    13/13  21-11428    any inconsistency between the guidelines and the text of the present instruction, the  provisions of the present instruction shall prevail.

"accountability","UNITED UNITED ST NATIONS NATIONS Secretariat ST/AI/401 18 January 1995 ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION To: Members of the staff From: The Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management Subject: PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES 1. Consistent with the desire of the General Assembly, expressed in its resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, for the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to exercise operational independence under the authority of the Secretary-General in the conduct of its duties, the Secretary-General defined in bulletin ST/SGB/273 the scope of the authority of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services in personnel matters, as follows: (a) In keeping with the need for operational independence, the Under- Secretary-General shall, through appropriate arrangements of delegation of authority, exercise the degree of latitude and control over the personnel and resources of the Office, consistent with the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, that is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Office; (b) With respect to the staff of the Office, the Under-Secretary-General shall have powers of appointment, promotion and termination similar to those delegated by the Secretary-General to the heads of programmes, funds or subsidiary organs enjoying special status in these matters. Contracts of staff members appointed by the Under-Secretary-General shall be limited to service with the Office. Staff members holding regular United Nations appointments who are selected to serve with the Office shall retain their current status and their acquired rights under the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. 2. The purpose of the present instruction is to outline the administrative arrangements and the authority of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services in personnel matters. 95-01551 (E) 200195 /... ST/AI/401 Page 2 3. The Staff Regulations adopted by the General Assembly and the Staff Rules and administrative instructions promulgated by the Secretary-General pursuant thereto will apply to staff members serving with the Office in the same manner as they do to the rest of the Secretariat. 4. Staff members presently serving with the Office who were appointed by the Secretary-General on the recommendation of the United Nations appointment and promotion machinery on permanent or fixed-term appointments will continue to be governed by the terms of appointment and conditions of service specified in their letters of appointment. Their acquired rights and eligibility for reassignment within the Secretariat will not be affected. 5. Subject to the retention by the Secretary-General of his authority to promulgate and interpret the Staff Regulations and Rules and to take final decisions in appeals and disciplinary cases under the Staff Regulations and in compensation claims under Appendix D of the Staff Rules, full authority is delegated to the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services by the Secretary-General as specified below, thus giving the Under-Secretary-General the responsibility for administering, in the name of the Secretary-General, the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules in respect of staff members serving with the Office. 6. To this end, the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Under- Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services, will establish an OIOS Appointment and Promotion Panel to advise the Under-Secretary-General on the appointment, promotion and termination of all staff members up to and including the D-2 level. The Panel will consist of three members and three alternates: a chairperson to be nominated by the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services, a member nominated by the staff of the Office and a senior staff member from the Department of Administration and Management. The Office of Human Resources Management will be represented ex officio. The functions and procedures of the Panel will be generally comparable to those of other United Nations appointment and promotion bodies. Secretariat policies, including the special measures to improve the status of women in the Secretariat, will apply. 7. Staff members for the Office will be recruited specifically for service with the Office rather than with the Secretariat as a whole. Their letters of appointment will indicate that their services are limited to the Office. Such staff members will be regarded as external candidates in filling vacancies in other departments. Movements of such staff members between the Office and other parts of the Secretariat will be subject to the same conditions and arrangements as are applicable to staff members serving with voluntarily funded programmes of the United Nations. 8. The principle of recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible will govern the appointment of Professional staff members. Such staff members will be reported separately to the General Assembly in the Secretary-General's annual report on the composition of the Secretariat. 9. Thus, in accordance with the relevant staff rules, the Under-Secretary- General for Internal Oversight Services will have authority to appoint all staff members whose appointments are limited to service with the Office up to the /... ST/AI/401 Page 3 D-2 level, to promote staff members up to the D-1 level, and to terminate appointments of such staff members, except for termination under article X of the Staff Regulations, but including terminations for unsatisfactory services, with the advice of the OIOS Appointment and Promotion Panel. 10. Staff members of the Office will be recruited and administered by the Office of Human Resources Management on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services. The provisions of bulletin ST/SGB/213/Rev.1, concerning designation of staff members performing significant functions in financial management, personnel management and general services administration, shall be applicable to the Office. 11. The administrative bodies established by the Secretary-General to advise him on staff matters, such as the Joint Appeals Board, the Joint Disciplinary Committee, the Claims Board and the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims, will have jurisdiction as regards all staff members serving with the Office. ----- "

The planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation cycle  established by the United Nations through resolutions and decisions of the General  Assembly aims at the following:     (a)  To subject all programmes of the Organization to periodic and thorough  reviews;     (b)  To afford an opportunity for reflection before choices among the various  types of action possible are made in the light of all existing conditions;     (c)  To associate in that reflection all participants in the Organization's actions,  especially Member States and the Secretariat;     (d)  To assess what is feasible and derive from this assessment objectives that  are both feasible and politically acceptable to Member States as a whole;     (e)  To translate those objectives into programmes and workplans in which the  responsibilities and tasks of those who are to implement them are specified;     (f)  To indicate to Member States the resources needed to design and  implement activities and to ensure that those resources are utilized according to  legislative intent and in the most effective and economical manner;     (g)  To provide a framework for setting priorities among activities;     (h)  To establish an independent and effective system for monitoring  implementation and verifying the effectiveness of the work actually done;     (i)  To evaluate periodically the results achieved, with a view either to  confirming the validity of the orientations chosen or to reshaping the programmes  towards different orientations.   2.  In pursuance of the above aims, the following instruments are to be utilized in  the Organization:     (a)  The strategic framework, whereby the orientation of the Organization's  activities is provided;     (b)  The programme budget and the programme performance report, in which  the Secretariat is committed to precise workplans involving delivery of output and  where implementation thereof is monitored and reported;     (c)  The evaluation system, which allows for continuing critical review of  achievements, collective thinking thereon and formulation of subsequent plans.       ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  6/20       Article I     Applicability         Regulation 1.1         The present Regulations shall govern the  planning, programming, monitoring and evaluation  of all activities undertaken by the United Nations,  irrespective of their source of financing.       Rule 101.1       (a)  The present Rules are promulgated in  implementation of the provisions of the Regulations  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme  Aspects  of  the  Budget,  the  Monitoring  of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation. They  shall govern the planning, programming, monitoring  and evaluation of United Nations activities, except as  may otherwise be provided by the General Assembly or  specifically exempted by the Secretary-General. Such  cases will be brought to the attention of the General  Assembly. The Management Committee, on behalf of  the  Secretary-General,  shall  be  responsible  for  overseeing the application of these Rules.     (b)  Planning for activities to be partially or fully  financed by extrabudgetary funds shall be provisional,  and such activities will be implemented only if adequate  funds are made available.     (c)  Due consideration shall be given in the  planning, programming, monitoring and evaluation  process to the specific nature of the varied activities of  the Organization, some of which may arise from events  that cannot be foreseen or planned, bearing in mind, in  particular, the responsibilities of the Security Council  under the Charter of the United Nations.          Article II      Instruments of  integrated management          Regulation 2.1         Activities undertaken by the United Nations  shall be submitted to an integrated management  process reflected in the following instruments:     (a)  Strategic frameworks;     (b)  Programme budgets;     (c)  Reports on programme performance;     (d)  Evaluation reports.   Each of these instruments corresponds to one phase  in the programme-planning cycle and, consequently,  shall serve as a framework for the subsequent phases.          Regulation 2.2         The planning, programming, budgeting and  evaluation cycle shall form an integral part of the  general policy-making and management process of  the Organization. The instruments referred to in  regulation 2.1 shall be used to ensure that activities  are coordinated and that the available resources are  utilized according to legislative intent and in the  most effective and economical manner.          Article III      Planning, programming and  budgeting process          Regulation 3.1      Planning, programming and  budgeting process       1.  The planning, programming and budgeting  process shall be governed, inter alia, by the following  principles:     (a)  Strict adherence to the principles and  provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, in  particular Articles 17 and 18 thereof;     (b)  Full respect for the prerogatives of the  principal organs of the United Nations with respect  to the planning, programming and budgeting process;     (c)  Full respect for the authority and the  prerogatives of the Secretary-General as the Chief  Administrative Officer of the Organization;     (d)  Recognition of the need for Member States  to participate in the preparation of the budget at the  early stages and throughout the process.   2.  The process for the formulation of the strategic  framework shall include:     (a)  Full  implementation  of  the  present  regulations as they  pertain  to the  strategic  framework;     (b)  Consultations  in  a  systematic  way  regarding  the  programmes  in  the  strategic  framework with sectoral, technical, regional and  central bodies of the United Nations;     ST/SGB/2018/3    7/20  18-08803      (c)  Drawing up by the Secretary-General, in  consultation with the Committee for Programme and  Coordination, of a calendar for such consultations.          Regulation 3.2      Budget process        A. Off-budget years     1.  The Secretary-General shall submit an outline  of the programme budget for the following biennium,  which shall contain an indication of the following:     (a)  A preliminary estimate of the resources  required to accommodate the proposed programme  of activities during the biennium;     (b)  Priorities, reflecting general trends of a  broad sectoral nature;     (c)  Real  growth,  positive  or  negative,  compared with the previous budget;     (d)  The size of the contingency fund expressed  as a percentage of the overall level of resources.   2.  On the basis of a decision by the General  Assembly, the Secretary-General shall prepare his  proposed programme budget for the following  biennium.   3.  Throughout this process, the mandate and  functions  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions shall be  fully respected. The Advisory Committee shall  consider the outline of the programme budget in  accordance with its terms of reference.      B. Budget years     4.  The  Secretary-General  shall  submit  his  proposed programme budget to the Committee for  Programme and Coordination and the Advisory  Committee  on Administrative  and  Budgetary  Questions in accordance with existing procedures.   5.  The  Committee  for  Programme  and  Coordination and the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions shall  examine the proposed programme budget in  accordance with their respective mandates and shall  submit their conclusions and recommendations to  the General Assembly, through its Fifth Committee,  for final approval of the programme budget.   6.  The programme narratives of the programme  budget fascicles shall be identical to the biennial  programme plan.   7.  The Secretary-General shall include in the  introduction to budget fascicles information on  the new and/or revised mandates approved by the  General Assembly subsequent to the adoption of the  biennial programme plan. The Committee for  Programme and Coordination, in performing its  programmatic role in the planning and budgetary  process, shall review the programmatic aspects of the  new and/or revised mandates referred to above, as  well as any differences that arise between the  biennial programme plan and the programmatic  aspects of the proposed programme budget.   8.  The  programme  budget  shall  include  expenditures related to political activities of a  perennial character whose mandates are renewed  annually, together with their related conference costs.        Rule 103.1       An outline of the proposed programme budget  shall be submitted to the General Assembly by  15 August of the off-budget year.          Article IV      Strategic framework         Regulation 4.1         A strategic framework shall be proposed by the  Secretary-General. It shall comprise in one document:     (a)  Part one: a plan outline, reflecting the  longer-term objectives of the Organization;     (b)  Part two: a biennial programme plan, to  cover two years.        Rule 104.1       The strategic framework shall be based on the  following principal criteria, inter alia:     (a)  Longer-term objectives consistent with all  the relevant legislative mandates in all areas of the  activities of the United Nations;     (b)  Outcomes  of  intergovernmental  conferences and summits;     (c)  Inputs  from  relevant  programme  managers;     (d)  Use of intergovernmentally agreed terms  and expressions.     ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  8/20       Rule 104.2       (a)  The Secretary-General shall prepare part  one, the plan outline, reflecting the longer-term  objectives of the Organization.     (b)  The Secretary-General shall prepare part  two, the biennial programme plan, to cover two years.     (c)  Instructions shall be issued in accordance  with the present Regulations and Rules for the  formulation of strategic framework proposals. Heads  of departments (as defined in financial rule 101.3 (c))  and offices shall submit to the Secretary-General  proposals for the programmes falling within their  area(s) of competence, in such detail, at such time  and through such channels as the Secretary-General  may require.     (d)  The Secretary-General shall establish a  timetable in order to guarantee the submission of the  proposed strategic framework and its revisions to the  Committee for Programme and Coordination, in  accordance with the six-week documentation rule, no  later than the end of April.          Regulation 4.2         The strategic framework shall be a translation  of legislative mandates into programmes and  subprogrammes. Its objectives and strategies shall be  derived from the policy orientations and goals set by  the intergovernmental organs. It shall clearly reflect  Member States' priorities as set out in legislation  adopted by functional and regional intergovernmental  bodies within their spheres of competence and by the  General Assembly, on advice from the Committee for  Programme and Coordination.        Rule 104.3       (a)  Requests and directives to the Secretary- General contained in resolutions or decisions of relevant  intergovernmental organs constitute legislative mandates  for proposed activities. Legislation establishing an  organizational unit or providing the general mandate for  work in an area should not be cited unless it is the only  mandate for the activities proposed.     (b)  Only United Nations intergovernmental  organs are competent to provide a legislative mandate.  Decisions or conclusions of intergovernmental organs  that are not organs of the United Nations may become a  mandate after they are endorsed by an intergovernmental  organ of the United Nations.     (c)  Unless it mandates continuing functions of  the Organization, a legislative mandate adopted more  than five years before the strategic framework review  should be accompanied by an explanation justifying its  retention as a mandate.     (d)  New activities that may be proposed by the  Secretary-General in fulfilment of the general objectives  of the Organization shall be given a legislative mandate  through the adoption of the strategic framework by the  General Assembly.          Regulation 4.3         The strategic framework and the budget outline  shall together form the basis for preparation of the  proposed programme budget.          Regulation 4.4         The strategic framework shall cover all  activities, both substantive and servicing, including  those to be financed partially or fully from  extrabudgetary and other assessed resources.        Rule 104.4       Strategic framework proposals shall be submitted  to the General Assembly through the Committee for  Programme and Coordination.          Regulation 4.5         The strategic framework shall be presented by  programme and subprogramme. There shall be  congruence,  to  the  extent  possible,  of  the  programmatic and organizational structure of the  Secretariat. Each programme shall contain a  narrative identifying the mandates that provide the  overall orientation for the programme. Each  subprogramme shall contain a narrative, which  should reflect all mandated activities and identify  objectives  of  the  Organization,  expected  accomplishments of the Secretariat and indicators of  achievement and strategies to be used during the  plan period to contribute to the achievement of the  expected accomplishments and objectives.        Rule 104.5       (a)  Each programme of the strategic framework  shall be presented in a separate chapter and shall contain  subprogrammes where appropriate.     ST/SGB/2018/3    9/20  18-08803      (b)  The subprogramme structure of the strategic  framework shall determine the subprogramme structure  of the programme budgets for the biennium.     (c)  The subprogramme structure shall, to the  extent possible, correspond to an organizational unit,  normally at the divisional level. The General Assembly  may modify the subprogramme structure of the  programme budget when it adopts the programme budget.     (d)  For substantive activities:     (i)  Each  programme  shall  contain  an  introductory narrative describing the relationship  of planned activities to the overall strategy  reflected in the decisions of the General Assembly  for the period covered by the strategic framework  and the rationale for selecting the objectives and  the subprogrammes intended to attain them. Such  an analysis should take into account the situation  in the sector in question, the problems that had  been identified and the progress made by the  international community towards solving those  problems. The narrative shall describe the actions  expected  from  both  Member  States  and  international organizations, as well as the linkages  with other programmes;     (ii)  The subprogramme shall be the main unit of  analysis, review and evaluation in the United  Nations planning and programming system.          Regulation 4.6         Part one of the strategic framework shall be the  plan outline, which will constitute a key integral  element of the planning process. The plan outline  shall be derived from legislative mandates set by  intergovernmental organs, shall identify future  challenges and shall:     (a)  Highlight in a coordinated manner the  policy orientation of the United Nations;     (b)  Indicate the longer-term objectives and  strategy and the trends deduced from mandates that  reflect priorities set by intergovernmental organs as  well as future challenges;     (c)  Contain the Secretary-General's proposals  on priorities.          Regulation 4.7         The strategic framework shall cover a two-year  period and shall be submitted to the General  Assembly one year before the submission of the  proposed programme budget covering the same two- year period.          Regulation 4.8         The programmes and subprogrammes of the  proposed strategic framework shall be reviewed by  the relevant sectoral, functional and regional  intergovernmental bodies, if possible during the  regular cycle of their meetings, prior to their review  by the Committee for Programme and Coordination,  the Economic and Social Council and the General  Assembly. The Committee for Programme and  Coordination shall consider the proposed strategic  framework in accordance with its terms of reference.        Rule 104.6       (a)  Programme managers shall prepare, in  conformity with the present Regulations and Rules and  the instructions issued by the Secretary-General, and  under the policy guidance of the heads of departments  and offices, a draft of their portions of the strategic  framework.     (b)  Programme managers shall draft their  portions of the strategic framework in time for them to  be reviewed by the organs referred to in regulations 4.8  and 4.9.     (c)  When those organs are considering the  proposed strategic framework, the Secretariat shall draw  their attention to the provisions of the present  Regulations and Rules.     (d)  After this review has been completed,  programme  managers  shall  send  the  following  documents to the Office of Programme Planning,  Budget and Accounts:     (i)  The draft strategic framework as presented to  the relevant body;     (ii)  That part of the report of the body covering  its review of the draft strategic framework and its  recommendations for changes;     (iii) The redrafted strategic framework reflecting  those recommendations where appropriate.     (e)  When the above-mentioned documents have  been received, the narratives of the programmes and  subprogrammes will be adjusted to incorporate changes  needed to ensure coherence, improve coordination and  avoid overlap. The formulation of the proposed strategic  framework shall be supervised by the Management  Committee.   ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  10/20      (f)  The proposed strategic framework will then  be issued in fascicles as a General Assembly document  and made available to the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, the Economic and Social Council and  the General Assembly.     (g)  The strategic framework, as approved by the  General Assembly, will be printed as a single document.          Regulation 4.9         The participation of sectoral, functional and  regional organs in the formulation of the strategic  framework shall be achieved by means of an  appropriate preparation period. To that end, the  Secretary-General shall provide proposals for the  coordination of their calendars of meetings. The  activities in the strategic framework shall be  coordinated with those of the concerned specialized  agencies through prior consultations.        Rule 104.7       The Secretary-General shall take appropriate  measures to submit proposals to the sectoral, functional  and regional bodies to enable them to review the  relevant portions of the strategic framework or its  revisions with a view to facilitating their consideration  by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and  the General Assembly.          Regulation 4.10         The General Assembly shall consider the  proposed strategic framework in the light of the  comments and recommendations of the Economic  and  Social  Council  and  the  Committee  for  Programme and Coordination. The Assembly shall  decide to accept, curtail, reformulate or reject each  of the subprogrammes proposed in the strategic  framework.          Regulation 4.11         After its adoption by the General Assembly, the  strategic framework shall constitute the principal  policy directive of the United Nations and shall serve  as the basis for programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and evaluation. The strategic framework  will comprise:     (a)  Part one: a plan outline, reflecting the  longer-term objectives of the Organization;     (b)  Part two: a biennial programme plan to  cover two years.   The strategic framework will also contain a  description of the strategies to be followed and the  methods to be used.        Rule 104.8       In the subprogrammes of the proposed strategic  framework:     (a)  Objectives for Secretariat action shall be, to  the greatest extent possible, concrete and time-limited.  Achievement  of  the  objectives  and  expected  accomplishments should be verifiable either directly or  through evaluation. Indicators of achievement should be  given where possible;     (b)  When an objective for Secretariat action  cannot be achieved by the end of the plan period, both  this longer-term objective and more specific objective(s)  to be achieved within the plan period shall be set;     (c)  The strategy for the subprogrammes shall  describe the course of action, the type of activities to be  carried out (research, technical assistance, support of  negotiations, etc.) and the programme framework within  which the budget will be prepared, which can be  expected to result in the fulfilment of the objectives set;     (d)  The strategy shall briefly describe the  situation that is expected to have been reached at the  beginning of the plan period and the approach that will  be taken during the plan period to achieve the objective;     (e)  The objectives and strategy shall encompass  all activities proposed within a subprogramme.          Regulation 4.12         Sectoral, functional and regional programme- formulating organs shall refrain from undertaking  new activities that are not programmed in the  strategic framework unless a pressing need of an  unforeseeable nature arises, as determined by the  General Assembly.          Regulation 4.13         The  Committee  for  Programme  and  Coordination, in performing its programmatic role  in the planning and budgeting process, shall review  the programmatic aspects of the new and/or revised  mandates approved by the General Assembly  subsequent to the adoption of the biennial programme  plan, as well as any differences that arise between the    ST/SGB/2018/3    11/20  18-08803    biennial programme plan and the programmatic  aspects of the proposed programme budget. All  revisions proposed by the Secretary-General shall be  as detailed as  necessary to  incorporate the  programme implications of the resolutions and  decisions adopted by intergovernmental organs and  international conferences since the adoption of the  biennial programme plan.        Rule 104.9       (a)  Revisions to the strategic framework are  required, inter alia:     (i)  When intergovernmental mandates adopted  after the adoption of the strategic framework call  for new or substantially modified programmes and  subprogrammes or any other revisions that should  be properly identified;     (ii)  When the programme mandates in the opinion  of the Secretary-General have become obsolete;     (iii) When  the  Secretary-General  deems it  necessary to propose new activities at the  subprogramme level not covered by existing  legislative mandates.     (b)  Substantive revisions shall be those which  propose a change in the objective(s) or the strategy of  the programme or subprogramme.          Regulation 4.14         The establishment of priorities among both  substantive programmes and common support  services shall form an integral part of the general  planning and management process without prejudice  to arrangements and procedures now in force or to  the specific character of servicing activities. Such  priorities shall be based on the importance of the  objective to Member States, the Organization's  capacity to achieve it and the real effectiveness and  usefulness of the results.          Regulation 4.15         Specialized  intergovernmental  and  expert  bodies, when reviewing the relevant programmes of  the strategic framework within their sphere of  competence, shall refrain from establishing priorities  that are not consistent with the overall priorities  established in the strategic framework.          Regulation 4.16         The priorities, as determined by the General  Assembly, established in the strategic framework  shall guide the allocation of budgetary and  extrabudgetary  resources  in  the  subsequent  programme budgets. After the strategic framework  has been adopted by the Assembly, the Secretary- General shall bring the decisions on priorities to the  attention of Member States and the governing boards  of the voluntary funds.        Rule 104.10       The allocation of resources proposed by the  Secretary-General in the subsequent programme budgets  shall be made in accordance with regulations 3.2 and 5.1  to 5.9.          Article V      Programme aspects of the budget          Regulation 5.1         The budget outline shall be submitted and  considered for approval by the General Assembly  after consideration and adoption of the strategic  framework. After their approval by the Assembly,  the strategic framework and the budget outline shall  together form the basis for preparation of the  proposed programme budget. In order to facilitate  this relationship, the programme budget shall have  financial information at the programme and  subprogramme levels.        Rule 105.1       As provided in rule 104.5 (b), the subprogramme  structure of the programme budget shall be identical to  that of the strategic framework unless a change in the  subprogramme structure has been authorized by a  subsequent legislative mandate. The financial data  provided in the proposed programme budget shall be  linked to the strategic framework at the programme and  subprogramme levels. At the subprogramme level,  estimates of the required resources, expressed as a  percentage of the programme resources, shall be  provided.          Regulation 5.2         The programme proposals set out in the budget  shall aim at achieving the objectives established in  the strategic framework. Programme proposals that  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  12/20    are not derived from the objectives shall be  submitted only as a result of legislation passed  subsequent to the adoption of the strategic  framework or its latest revision.        Rule 105.2       No activity or output shall be included in the  proposed programme budget unless it is clearly in  implementation of the strategic framework strategy and  is likely to help to achieve the objectives of the strategic  framework, or it is in implementation of legislation  passed subsequent to the approval or revision of the  strategic framework.          Regulation 5.3         In the proposed programme budget, the  requested resources shall be justified in terms of the  requirements of output delivery in contributing to  the expected accomplishments.        Rule 105.3       For all activities, programme budget submissions  provided to the Secretary-General will include, at the  appropriate level of detail, data on the resources  required, such as requirements for posts, travel,  consultants and other relevant objects of expenditure.  These data will be used in internal budget formulation  procedures as a basis for programme budget proposals.  The programme narrative describing servicing activities  shall include, wherever possible, quantitative indicators  measuring the services rendered and showing any  expected change in productivity during the biennium.          Regulation 5.4         The proposed programme budget shall be  divided into parts, sections and programmes.  Programme narratives shall set out subprogrammes,  outputs, objectives and accomplishments expected  during the biennium. The proposed programme  budget shall be preceded by a statement explaining  the main changes made in the content of the  programme and the volume of resources allocated to  it in relation to the previous biennium. The proposed  programme budget shall be accompanied by such  information, annexes and explanatory statements as  may be requested by or on behalf of the General  Assembly and such further annexes or statements as  the Secretary-General may deem necessary and  useful.        Rule 105.4       (a)  The programme narratives for all activities  shall conform to the following standards:     (i)  All final outputs included in the proposed  programme budget shall clearly contribute to the  achievement  of  a  subprogramme  objective  identified in the strategic framework;     (ii)  Output descriptions shall conform to the  following standard categories of final output:       a.  Servicing of intergovernmental and  expert bodies, including reports thereto;       b.  Other substantive activities;       c.  International  cooperation  and  inter-agency coordination and liaison;       d.  Conference services;       e.  Technical cooperation;       f.  Administrative support services;     (iii) Expected  accomplishments  shall  be  formulated for each subprogramme and shall  identify those benefits or changes expected to  accrue to users or beneficiaries through the delivery  of final outputs. Expected accomplishments shall  be in conformity with and lead to the fulfilment of  the objectives established in the programmes and  subprogrammes. Expected accomplishments shall  be expressed in terms that will facilitate the  subsequent  determination  of  whether  the  expectations  have  been  met.  Expected  accomplishments shall be objective, feasible and  pertinent to the nature of and the work carried out  by each subprogramme.     (b)  The programme narratives for servicing  activities shall identify the services to be delivered by  nature and quantity. Wherever possible, standard  categories of services shall be established.          Regulation 5.5         All activities for which resources are requested  in the proposed programme budget shall be  programmed.        Rule 105.5       All activities, whether financed from regular budget  or extrabudgetary resources, shall be programmed in the  sense that:     ST/SGB/2018/3    13/20  18-08803      (a)  Output descriptions as stipulated under rule  105.4 shall apply, irrespective of the resources used for  producing the output;     (b)  Financial information as stipulated under  rule 105.3 shall be provided in internal budget  formulation data for both categories of funds.          Regulation 5.6         Within the proposed programme budget, the  Secretary-General shall submit to the General  Assembly, with justification, a list of outputs  included in the previous budgetary period which, in  the judgement of the Secretary-General, can be  discontinued and which, as a consequence, have not  been included in the proposed programme budget.        Rule 105.6       In  their  budgetary  submissions,  heads  of  departments and offices shall provide the Secretary- General with a list of outputs and activities required by  legislation or approved in a previous budgetary period  that have not been included in the proposed programme  budget because they are considered obsolete, of  marginal usefulness or ineffective, and that therefore  could be proposed for termination by the General  Assembly. The determination of such outputs shall be  made by applying, inter alia, the following criteria:     (a)  Outputs  and  activities  derived  from  mandates that are at least five years old, unless a  relevant intergovernmental body has reaffirmed the  continuing validity of the mandate;     (b)  Outputs and activities whose legislative  basis has been superseded by new mandates;     (c)  Outputs and activities that were programmed  as new outputs in the budget for the previous biennium  but that were not implemented in that biennium; if such  outputs are to be included in the budget, justification  must be provided;     (d)  Outputs and activities that, during the  in-depth evaluation of a programme by the Committee  for Programme and Coordination or a review of the  programme by the relevant functional or regional  intergovernmental organ, were found to be obsolete, of  marginal usefulness or ineffective.          Regulation 5.7         The  Secretary-General  shall  provide  the  Committee for Programme and Coordination and  the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions with advance copies of the  proposed programme budget by the end of April of  the year preceding the budgetary period.        Rule 105.7       (a)  Heads of departments and offices shall  submit programme proposals and corresponding budget  estimates at such time and in such detail as the  Secretary-General may prescribe and in accordance with  the present Regulations and Rules.     (b)  Taking into account the deliberations of the  Management Committee, the Secretary-General shall  decide on the programme content and resource allocation  of the budget to be submitted to the General Assembly.     (c)  The programmes of work submitted by  programme managers to specialized intergovernmental  organs should contain activities and output specifications  identical to those set out in the programme portion of  the proposed programme budget. This does not preclude  the addition of further information and detail if required  by the specialized intergovernmental organs.          Regulation 5.8         The  Committee  for  Programme  and  Coordination shall review the proposed programme  budget to ensure that the narratives of the  programme budget fascicles are identical to the  approved biennial programme plan and report on its  deliberations. The report of the Committee shall be  communicated to the General Assembly and the  Economic and Social Council for their consideration.          Regulation 5.9         No council, commission or other competent  body shall take a decision involving either a change  in the programme budget approved by the General  Assembly or the possible requirement of expenditure  unless it has received and taken account of a report  from the Secretary-General on the programme  budget implications of the proposal.        Rule 105.8       It shall be the responsibility of the head of the  department concerned, in consultation with the Office of  Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, to ensure  that a report on programme budget implications, as  required by regulation 5.9, is submitted to the General  Assembly prior to its adoption of any resolution or  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  14/20    decision. The report should integrate the programme,  financial and administrative implications of draft  resolutions and include the following information:     (a)  Modifications of the work programme that  would be necessary should the proposed draft  resolution, recommendation or decision be adopted,  listing additions, changes or deletions to programmes,  subprogrammes, outputs and activities;     (b)  Indications, where applicable, of similar or  closely related work being carried out elsewhere in the  Secretariat and, if possible, indications of related  activities being conducted in the specialized agencies of  the United Nations system;     (c)  In cases where it is proposed to finance such  additional activities totally or partly through the  redeployment of existing resources, an indication of the  outputs or subprogrammes in the current work  programme that would be changed, curtailed or  terminated as a consequence.          Article VI      Monitoring of  programme implementation          Regulation 6.1         The  Secretary-General  shall  monitor  accomplishments by subprogramme, as measured by  indicators of achievement and the delivery of outputs  scheduled in the approved programme budget,  through the Department of Management. After the  completion of the biennial budget period, the  Secretary-General shall report to the General  Assembly, through the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, on programme performance  during that period.        Rule 106.1       (a)  The Department of Management shall:     (i)  Monitor changes made during the biennium  in the programme of work set out in the programme  budget approved by the General Assembly;     (ii)  At the end of the biennium, report on the  actual progress made towards achieving expected  accomplishments, as measured by the indicators,  and towards delivery of final outputs, in  comparison with the commitments set out in the  programme narratives of the approved programme  budget and report thereon to the General Assembly  through the Committee for Programme and  Coordination. This monitoring and performance  reporting shall cover all activities in the  programme budget.     (b)  Programme performance shall be reported in  accordance with the following procedures:     (i)  Heads of departments and offices shall  submit biennial programme performance reports  for their departments at such time and in such  detail as the Secretary-General may prescribe;     (ii)  The Department of Management shall be  responsible for reporting on programme delivery  and preparing the related report to the General  Assembly.     (c)  The Office of Internal Oversight Services  shall conduct ad hoc detailed audits of programme and  output delivery.     (d)  In the programme performance report, final  outputs shall be listed according to the following  categories:     (i)  Completed as programmed;     (ii)  Postponed to the following biennium,  whether commenced or not;     (iii) Completed but significantly reformulated;     (iv) Terminated  as  obsolete,  of  marginal  usefulness or ineffective;     (v)  Additional output required by a legislative  decision subsequent to the approval of the  programme budget;     (vi) Additional output initiated by the programme  manager.   An implementation rate based on the above categories  shall be assigned to each programme in the programme  performance report. Explanations shall be provided in the  programme performance report for low implementation  rates and, upon the request of Member States, for any  other departures from programmed commitments.     (e)  In the programme performance report, the  assessment of progress against objectives and expected  accomplishments required under rule 106.1 (a) (ii) shall  be provided, to the extent possible, by subprogramme.  An explanation shall be given for lack of progress.          Regulation 6.2         An  entire  subprogramme  shall  not  be  reformulated nor a new programme introduced in  the programme budget without the prior approval of    ST/SGB/2018/3    15/20  18-08803    an intergovernmental body and the General  Assembly. The Secretary-General may make such  proposals  for  review  by  the  relevant  intergovernmental body if he or she considers that  circumstances so warrant.        Rule 106.2       Programme implementation shall be monitored  under the following procedures:     (a)  Heads of departments or offices shall  establish internal programme-monitoring procedures  pursuant to guidelines established by the Department of  Management;     (b)  Within  any  subprogramme,  heads  of  departments or offices shall have the discretion with full  justification to modify the approved programme budget  by reformulating final outputs, postponing delivery of  outputs to the following biennium or terminating outputs,  provided that such changes are in pursuance of the  objective and strategy of the subprogramme as set out in  the strategic framework. Such proposed changes shall  be reported through the Department of Management;     (c)  Subject to the procedures established under  (a) and (b) above, changes in the programme of work  mandated by a competent intergovernmental organ that  can be implemented within existing resources may be  implemented by the department or office concerned;     (d)  Changes in the programme of work requiring  net additional resources may not be implemented before  they are approved by the General Assembly.          Regulation 6.3         The Secretary-General shall transmit the  biennial programme performance report to all  Member States by the end of the first quarter  following the completion of the biennial budgetary  period.          Article VII      Evaluation          Regulation 7.l         The objective of evaluation is:     (a)  To  determine  as  systematically  and  objectively as possible the relevance, efficiency,  effectiveness and impact of the Organization's  activities in relation to their objectives;     (b)  To enable the Secretariat and Member  States to engage in systematic reflection, with a view  to  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  main  programmes of the Organization by altering their  content and, if necessary, reviewing their objectives.        Rule 107.1       (a)  The  objectives  of  a  programme  or  subprogramme shall be the standards against which its  relevance, effectiveness and impact will be assessed. As  a necessary component of programme evaluation there  shall be an assessment of the relevance, quality and  usefulness of individual output and the effectiveness of  the output in achieving the time-limited subprogramme  objectives.     (b)  Baseline data and indicators of achievement  shall be utilized in the evaluation process to assess  programme impact in terms of the objectives. An  attempt shall be made to identify and analyse the factors  associated with effectiveness and impact.     (c)  Evaluation findings shall be communicated  to Member States through intergovernmental bodies and  to heads of departments and offices in order to facilitate  the reconsideration of existing mandates, policies,  strategies and objectives, the substantive content of  programmes and its utility to the users.          Regulation 7.2         All activities programmed shall be evaluated  over a fixed time period. An evaluation programme  as well as a timetable for intergovernmental review  of evaluation studies shall be proposed by the  Secretary-General and approved by the General  Assembly at the same time as the proposed strategic  framework.        Rule 107.2       (a)  All programmes shall be evaluated on a  regular,  periodic  basis. At  the  programme  or  subprogramme level, evaluation plans shall be linked to  the strategic framework, and they shall be integrated  with the programme budget cycle.     (b)  The evaluation system shall include periodic  self-evaluation of activities directed at time-limited  objectives  and  continuing  functions.  Programme  managers shall, in collaboration with their staff,  undertake self-evaluation of all subprogrammes under  their responsibility. Specifically:     (i)  The timing, scope and other characteristics  of a self-evaluation study shall be determined by  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  16/20    the nature and characteristics of the activities  programmed and other relevant factors;     (ii)  Methodological support shall be provided by  the Central Evaluation Unit in connection with the  preparation of self-evaluation reports;     (iii) Evaluation plans, which are required for  each new and ongoing subprogramme, shall be  prepared by programme managers and shall  contain the following elements: a definition of the  purpose of the evaluation and the anticipated  application of evaluation findings; the evaluation  methodology to be employed; the characteristics  of the evaluation (e.g., the scope of coverage and  the period covered); the measures of change  (e.g., the nature of the progress and the impact  indicators to be employed); the means of  information  collection;  the  administrative  arrangements; and the resource requirements.     (c)  In addition to self-evaluation, the evaluation  system shall include the ad hoc in-depth evaluation of  selected programme areas or topics conducted internally  or externally at the request of intergovernmental bodies  or at the initiative of the Secretariat. In determining  whether an in-depth evaluation should be carried out,  the results of self-evaluation shall be taken into account.  Specifically:     (i)  The evaluation proposals submitted by the  Secretary-General to the General Assembly for its  approval shall include a list of programmes or  portions of programmes to be covered on a regular,  periodic basis by in-depth evaluations and a  timetable indicating the years in which the related  reports are due;     (ii)  In-depth evaluation reports to be submitted  for consideration by the Committee for Programme  and Coordination or by the intergovernmental or  expert organs directly concerned with each  programme shall be prepared by the Central  Evaluation Unit, in collaboration with the  programme managers concerned and, if necessary,  competent experts in the fields involved. The Joint  Inspection Unit may also assist in the preparation  of such reports;     (iii) At least one in-depth evaluation study shall  be undertaken each year. Such a study shall  normally be completed within two years.          Regulation 7.3         Evaluation may be internal and/or external.  The  Secretary-General  shall  develop  internal  evaluation systems and seek the cooperation of  Member States in the evaluation process, as  appropriate. Evaluation methods shall be adapted to  the nature of the programme being evaluated. The  General Assembly shall invite such bodies as it sees  fit, including the Joint Inspection Unit, to perform ad  hoc external evaluations and to report on them.        Rule 107.3       (a)  Self-evaluation shall be conducted by  programme managers in compliance with guidelines  established by the Central Evaluation Unit, which will  be responsible for quality standards, methodology, the  adaptation and transfer of evaluation information and ad  hoc studies.     (b)  The United Nations programme categories  shall be used as a reference, but the primary focus of  self-evaluation shall be on the subprogramme, outputs  and activities.     (c)  Self-evaluation reports shall be concerned  with the effectiveness and impact of subprogrammes. In  them, programme managers shall:     (i)  Assess the quality and relevance of the  outputs  of  each  subprogramme  and  their  usefulness to the users;     (ii)  Compare the situation existing at the start of  the implementation of each subprogramme and  what remains to be done in order to ascertain the  extent to which a subprogramme has attained its  objective;     (iii) Analyse the extent to which the objectives of  the programme have been attained and the impact  of the totality of subprogrammes implemented in  the context of the programme;     (iv) Identify, in the light of such findings, other  possible designs for the programme; that is,  alternative  subprogrammes  that  might  be  considered in order to improve performance in  attaining the programme objectives.     (d)  The programme evaluation system shall  utilize all information collected during the programme  performance, monitoring and reporting process but shall  remain separate and distinct from that process.     (e)  The  programme  evaluation  system  is  separate and distinct from the personnel performance  appraisal system. Since the programme evaluation  system is concerned with programme effectiveness and  impact rather than the performance of individual staff  members, no information shall be transmitted between  the two systems.     ST/SGB/2018/3    17/20  18-08803       Regulation 7.4         The findings of the intergovernmental review of  evaluations  shall  be  reflected  in  subsequent  programme  design  and  delivery  and  policy  directives. To this end, a brief report summarizing  the conclusions of the Secretary-General on all  evaluation studies conducted in the established  evaluation programme shall be submitted to the  General Assembly at the same time as the text of the  proposed strategic framework.        Rule 107.4       (a)  Evaluation findings in respect of ongoing or  continuing activities shall be directly and immediately  communicated to those responsible for programme  planning and management to permit mid-course  correction if required.     (b)  The evaluation system shall include the  monitoring of action taken on the basis of evaluation  conclusions and recommendations.     (c)  Evaluation methods shall be made consistent  and comparable so as to facilitate the adaptation and  transfer of evaluation findings among United Nations  programmes.     (d)  The reporting of evaluation results shall  include a statement on the comprehensiveness and  rigour of the evaluation process; it shall clearly  differentiate between objective evidence, professional  technical judgements and political judgements of  Member  States,  and  all  its  conclusions  and  recommendations shall be supported by such evidence  and judgements. The recommendations contained in the  report shall be unambiguous and possible to implement.     (e)  Intergovernmental or expert committees  directly  concerned  with  each  programme  shall  formulate, in connection with the evaluation reports  submitted to them, recommendations concerning  methods of implementation and shall suggest, where  appropriate, a new design for the programme, resulting  in a new set of subprogrammes. Those recommendations  shall be transmitted to the Committee for Programme  and Coordination for consideration and, in the case of  programmes concerning servicing activities, to the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions as well.     (f)  After considering the recommendations of  the competent intergovernmental or expert organs and  the recommendations contained in the reports prepared  by the Central Evaluation Unit, the Committee for  Programme and Coordination shall propose to the  Economic and Social Council and to the General  Assembly measures that may relate to:     (i)  Changes in procedures used in implementing  ongoing programmes;     (ii)  The  redefinition  of  the  content  of  programmes and subprogrammes.     (g)  Measures thus proposed shall be considered  either in connection with the formulation of a new plan  after study by the intergovernmental bodies concerned of  the report summarizing the conclusions of the Secretary- General on the relevant evaluation studies, as envisaged  in regulation 7.4, or in connection with a biennial  revision of the plan, as envisaged in regulation 4.13.     (h)  A summary report shall be prepared  periodically to include findings of individual reports and  general conclusions on the design of the programmes  reviewed in order to assist in the preparation of the  strategic framework.       ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  18/20    Annex        Glossary of terms         Activity. Action taken to transform inputs into outputs.     Budget year. The second year of a biennium, in which the Secretary-General  submits the proposed programme budget for the following biennium.     Common services. Common services are either conference services rendered to  Member States or administrative services rendered by a single unit to more than one  department or office.     Competent intergovernmental organ. An intergovernmental organ is competent  to provide legislative mandates to the Secretariat in the areas covered by its terms of  reference as set out in intergovernmental resolutions or decisions, normally those  establishing its existence. Such competence may be global, regional, sectoral or  functional.     Delivery of output. An output is generally considered to have been delivered  when the service is completed or when the products resulting from a programme  activity are made available to the intended primary users; e.g., in the case of a report  or a technical publication, when it has been circulated to Member States, interested  Governments or other primary users; in the case of a sales publication, when it is  placed on sale.     Effectiveness is the extent to which objectives and expected accomplishments  are achieved.     Efficiency is measured by how well inputs are converted into outputs.     End-user is the recipient or beneficiary of an output or accomplishment.     Evaluation is a process that seeks to determine as systematically and objectively  as possible the relevance, effectiveness and impact of an activity in the light of its  goals, objectives and accomplishments. Specifically:     * In-depth evaluation is undertaken by the Central Evaluation Unit at the request  of the Committee for Programme and Coordination, as endorsed by the General  Assembly, or at the request of other intergovernmental bodies. It may also be  undertaken by evaluation units in regional and sectoral secretariats at the request  of their governing bodies. This type of evaluation may also be initiated by the  Secretary-General for a particular programme as the need arises. In-depth  evaluation focuses on the programme. On the basis of studies conducted by the  relevant evaluation unit for their consideration, the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, intergovernmental bodies at the regional and sectoral levels,  other technical intergovernmental bodies and appropriate expert bodies  concerned review entire programmes or the entire work of an entity in depth.  The objective is to make recommendations that would help the Economic and  Social Council and the General Assembly to formulate decisions aimed at  increasing the overall relevance, effectiveness and impact of the programmes of  the United Nations in the context of the intergovernmental goals and policies;     * Self-evaluation is undertaken by programme managers primarily for their own  use. Self-evaluation focuses on the subprogramme and can be applied to all  sectors, including political, legal, humanitarian, economic and social affairs,  public information and common services. As an integral part of the management  process, the design and conduct of the self-evaluation procedure are specified  at the planning and programming stages in conjunction with the design of the  relevant subprogramme. Findings are applied by the programme managers to    ST/SGB/2018/3    19/20  18-08803    make necessary adjustments in implementation or are fed back into the planning  and programming process in the form of proposed changes in the design and/or  orientation of the subprogramme or project concerned. While the results of self- evaluation are not normally reported at the intergovernmental level, the  conclusions drawn from the analytical information generated for various  subprogrammes and projects within a programme can be used as inputs for  assessing the programme as a whole;     * Internal evaluation covers both self-evaluation and in-depth evaluation (see  above);     * Ongoing evaluation is the examination of an activity during its implementation  to assess its continued relevance and progress towards the achievement of its  objectives;     * Ex post evaluation is the assessment of the relevance, effectiveness and impact  of an activity carried out some time after its completion.     Expected accomplishment is a desired outcome involving benefits to end users,  expressed as a quantitative or qualitative standard, value or rate. Accomplishments  are the direct consequence or effect of the generation of outputs and lead to the  fulfilment of a certain objective.     External evaluation is performed by entities outside the United Nations  Secretariat. The General Assembly invites such bodies as it sees fit, including the  Joint Inspection Unit, to carry out this type of evaluation.     External factors are events and/or conditions that are beyond the control of those  responsible for an activity but that have an influence on the success or failure of the  activity. They may be anticipated in the form of assumptions or they may be  unanticipated.     Impact is an expression of the changes produced in a situation as the result of  an activity that has been undertaken.     Indicators of achievement are used to measure whether and/or the extent to  which the objectives and/or expected accomplishments have been achieved.  Indicators correspond either directly or indirectly to the objective or the expected  accomplishment for which they are used to measure performance. Ideally, indicators  should be strategic, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound.    Inputs are personnel and other resources necessary for producing outputs.     Intergovernmental organ. An organ is intergovernmental if its membership  consists of Governments. Thus, United Nations bodies consisting of persons serving  in their individual capacities are not intergovernmental organs, even if the persons  concerned were nominated by Governments or elected by an intergovernmental  organ.     Legislative mandate. A legislative mandate is a request for action addressed to  the Secretary-General or an executive head acting on his behalf in a resolution or  decision adopted by a competent United Nations intergovernmental organ.     Monitoring. Monitoring is the periodic determination by the head of a  department or office of the actual delivery of final outputs in comparison with the  commitments for the delivery of outputs set out in the programme budget as approved  by the General Assembly.     Objective. In programme budgeting, objective refers to an overall desired  achievement involving a process of change and aimed at meeting certain needs of  identified end users within a given period of time.   ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  20/20      Off-budget year. The first year of a biennium, in which the Secretary-General  submits an outline of the proposed programme budget for the following biennium.     Outputs. Outputs are final products or services delivered by a programme or  subprogramme to end users, such as reports, publications, training, servicing of  meetings, or advisory, editorial, translation or security services, which an activity is  expected to produce in order to achieve its objectives.     Priority. A priority is a preferential rating for the allocation of limited resources.  Thus, activities with the highest priority are those that would be conducted even if  total resources were significantly curtailed; activities with the lowest priority are  those that would be curtailed or terminated if all anticipated resources were not  available or if activities with a higher priority had to be commenced or expanded.     Programme. A programme consists of the activities undertaken by a department  or office.     Programme manager. A programme manager is the Secretariat official  responsible for the formulation and implementation of a programme as defined above,  normally the head of an organizational unit. For the purposes of self-evaluation,  programme managers also refer to those who are involved in the implementation of  subprogrammes, namely, the head of a division, branch or section.     Programme strategy. A programme strategy is a sequence of means of action to  be undertaken for the purpose of achieving an objective.     Relevance. Relevance is the extent to which an activity, expected  accomplishment or strategy is pertinent or significant for achieving the related  objective and the extent to which the objective is significant to the problem addressed.  Relevance is viewed in the context of the activity's design as well as in the light of  the factual situation at the time of evaluation.     Subprogramme. A subprogramme consists of activities within a programme  aimed at achieving one or a few closely related objectives as set out in the strategic  framework. The subprogramme structure shall correspond, to the extent possible, to  an organizational unit, normally at the division level.     18-08803 (E)    050618  *1808803*  "
"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2010/1       Secretariat      14 January 2010    10-20984 (E)    210110  *1020984*         Administrative instruction         Reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations,  favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and  non-governmental sources        The Under-Secretary-General for Management, pursuant to section 4.2 of  Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2009/4, and for the purpose of implementing  the prohibition in staff regulation 1.2 and staff rule 1.2 against the receipt by staff of  honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and  non-governmental sources, promulgates the following:        Section 1  Scope and purpose    1.1 Staff regulation 1.2, under its subsections (j), (k) and (l), sets out the  prohibition against staff receiving any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources. Subsections (j) and  (k) of staff regulation 1.2 deal with the prohibition on acceptance from  governmental sources, and subsection (l) deals with the necessity of prior approval  by the Secretary-General for acceptance from non-governmental sources. Staff  rule 1.2, subsections (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o), covers these same matters. The text of  the relevant section of staff regulation 1.2 reads as follows:      ""Honours, gifts or remuneration      (j)  No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government;      (k)  If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift  from a Government would  cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff  member may receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and  entrust it to the Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the  Organization or arrange for its disposal for the benefit of the Organization or  for a charitable purpose;      (l)  No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the  approval of the Secretary-General.""  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  2    1.2 The intended purpose of the staff regulations and rules dealing with honours,  decorations,  favours,  gifts  or  remuneration  from  governmental  and  non-governmental sources is to ensure the independence and impartiality of staff  members. The only latitude that is allowed is when prior approval of the Secretary- General is obtained to accept an honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration  from a non-governmental source. The procedure for obtaining the Secretary- General's prior approval is detailed in section 5 below.  1.3 The operational procedures for implementing this prohibition in a manner that  is true to the intent and spirit of the regulations, while recognizing the practical  realities of situations that actually occur, have been found to require a more detailed  explanation than has existed up to now. The main purpose of the present  administrative instruction, therefore, is to describe a set of procedures that  emphasizes to staff their obligations and simultaneously provides guidance to  officials responsible for the management of this matter.  1.4 The present policy and procedures relate to honours, decorations, favours, gifts  or remuneration that are offered or presented by either governmental or  non-governmental sources in the course of staff members' official duties or in  relation to staff members' status as international civil servants. In the event of doubt  as to the applicability of this policy in a given situation, staff members are expected  to seek guidance from the United Nations Ethics Office.  1.5 Staff members carrying out functions in sensitive areas such as procurement  and investment management shall be subject to higher standards as considered  necessary in relation to the discharge of their duties and responsibilities, as defined  in appropriate guidelines issued by the Organization.        Section 2  Definitions    2.1 For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions shall apply:    (a)  Governmental source means:    (i)  Any unit of governmental authority, including any national, state, local  and municipal government;    (ii) Any intergovernmental organization; or    (iii) Any  agent  or  representative  of  a  governmental  authority  or  intergovernmental organization.    (b)  Non-governmental source means: any non-governmental organization,  academic institution or any private source. Educational institutions will be  considered as a non-governmental source.    (c)  Honour means: an award or recognition, tangible or intangible, given by  a governmental or non-governmental source. Such honours may include, inter alia,  medals, awards, plaques, certificates or scrolls.    (d)  Decoration means: an object that is awarded by a governmental or  non-governmental source to honour the recipient in a very visible manner. Such  decorations may include, inter alia, a medal, pin or ribbon.    ST/AI/2010/1   3  10-20984      (e)  Favour means: a special privilege or treatment granted to a staff member  by a governmental or non-governmental source.    (f)  Gift means: any item that has a physical form, offered to a staff member.  The term includes minor gifts of essentially nominal value, but does not include:    (i)  Participation in official functions (such as meals and diplomatic  receptions) for which staff members are invited as part of their official  functions (see staff rule 1.2 (n)). Staff members are expected to exercise  judgement and to refrain from accepting invitations that are or could be  perceived as inconsistent with the obligations and behaviour of United Nations  staff members;    (ii) Participation  in  activities  organized  by  governmental  or  non-governmental sources that has been authorized by the Secretary-General  in which the organizing entity covers the accommodation, travel and  subsistence allowance in line with that payable by the United Nations (see  staff rule 1.2 (u)).    (g)  Minor gift of essentially nominal value means: representational or  courtesy gifts of limited value that might be given to a staff member by a  governmental or non-governmental source as an expression of courtesy.    (h)  Remuneration means: any monetary compensation not associated with  approved outside occupation or employment established in section 3 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13.    (i)  Administering official means: Executive Officer or his/her equivalent in  other duty stations (e.g., Chief or Director of Administration for offices away from  headquarters, and Chief or Director of Mission Support for peacekeeping missions  and other peace operations) or another staff member designated by a head of office  to carry out the functions of an administering official.

Section 3  Obligations of staff members    3.1 When a situation presents itself in which an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is offered or presented to a staff member from a governmental or  non-governmental source, the appropriate response is for the staff member to  decline with an explanation that it is a requirement in accordance with the staff  member's duties and obligations as an international civil servant.  3.2 There may be other situations where the honour, decoration, favour or gift has  already been delivered or where the refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration,  favour or gift from a governmental or non-governmental source would cause  embarrassment to the Organization. In such cases, if the return of the honour,  decoration, favour or gift would cause embarrassment to the Organization, a staff  member may accept it, on behalf of the Organization, and shall promptly report and  entrust the item, irrespective of its value, to the administering official.  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  4    3.3 Staff members may not accept any honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from a governmental source or from any individual or entity doing  business with, or seeking to do business with, the Organization. However, in  exceptional cases United Nations staff members may request the prior approval of  the Secretary-General for accepting honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, as provided for in staff  regulation 1.2.  3.4 Staff members may accept on behalf of the Organization, without prior  approval from the Secretary-General, minor gifts of essentially nominal value from  a governmental or non-governmental source. In such instance, the requirement to  report and entrust the gift, as set out in section 3.2 above, shall apply, as well as the  procedure for recording, retention and disposal, as set out in section 4 below.        Section 4  Procedure for recording, retaining and disposing of minor gifts and anticipated  honours, decorations, favours, gifts and remuneration presented by  governmental and non-governmental sources    4.1 In accordance with the provisions of this administrative instruction, the  administering official shall establish and maintain a registry to record summary  information on all honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration that have  been accepted by staff members in accordance with sections 3.2 or 3.4. This register  shall contain the name and functional title of the recipient; a description of the event  that led to the honour, decoration, favour or gift that was presented; the name of the  governmental or non-governmental source; whether there is any relationship --  official or otherwise -- between the staff member and the governmental or  non-governmental source; the date of receipt; and the action taken for disposition as  described in section 4.2 below. This register shall be provided upon request to the  Under-Secretary-General for Management or to the Director of the Ethics Office.  4.2 Once the item has been recorded in the registry, and bearing in mind that any  honour, decoration, favour or gift must not be incompatible with the interests of the  Organization or give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest for the staff  member or the office concerned, the item will be disposed of or retained, in  consultation with the administering official, as detailed below:    (a)  Any honour, decoration, favour or gift from any individual or entity  doing business with or seeking to do business with the Organization shall be  promptly declined and returned;    (b)  Minor gifts of essentially nominal value may be retained by the recipient.  Those that are retained by the Organization will be dealt with in accordance with  section 4.3 below;    (c)  Any remuneration or the monetary portion of any honour, decoration,  favour or gift that is presented by a non-governmental source as a consequence of  performing United Nations duties and responsibilities should be either declined or  deposited to the Organization's bank account in consultation with the Office of the  Controller;    (d)  All other honours, decorations, favours or gifts shall be retained by the  Organization.    ST/AI/2010/1   5  10-20984    4.3 For those items retained by the Organization, the property management  official, on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, may allow the  honour, decoration or gift to be displayed or exhibited for educational, informational  or decorative purposes in any premises of the United Nations Organization. In all  other instances, the property management official shall dispose of the items,  whether individually or combined, by one of the means specified in financial rule  105.22. It will be the responsibility of the property management official to organize  the donation, sale or discarding of these items. For the purposes of disposal, the  honours, decorations and gifts that are the subject of this paragraph are not to be  considered surplus as a consequence of loss, damage or other discrepancies, and  therefore the advice of the Property Survey Board is not required. However, the  property management official may seek the advice of the Property Survey Board, as  necessary. In the event of sale, the net proceeds, after recovery of administrative  costs, shall be donated to the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize Memorial Fund,  established pursuant to Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2003/11.        Section 5  Procedure for obtaining the Secretary-General's approval to receive an honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from a non-governmental source    5.1 When a staff member becomes aware that he/she is being offered (i.e.,  considered, nominated or selected) to receive an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, the staff member shall notify in  writing the administering official of the name and functional title of the intended  recipient; the circumstances of the proposed offer; the nature of the honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration; the name and role of the source; and, if  possible, the estimated value. Pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (j) and staff rule  1.2 (o), honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration that are offered from a  governmental source or an individual or entity doing business with or seeking to do  business with the United Nations must be promptly declined.  5.2 The administering official shall communicate this information to the Assistant  Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, who may approve, on behalf  of the Secretary-General, the acceptance of the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source. The approval or non-approval shall  then be communicated back to the administering official, who shall in turn inform  the staff member concerned. The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management may consult with the Ethics Office, as needed.  5.3 It is only in exceptional cases that the Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources Management will grant approval, on behalf of the Secretary-General, for  the staff member to receive and retain an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, provided that:    (a)  It is not incompatible with the interests of the United Nations;    (b)  It is not incompatible with the staff member's status as an international  civil servant;    (c)  Any remuneration or the monetary portion of any honour, decoration,  favour or gift that is presented by a non-governmental source as a consequence of  performing United Nations duties and responsibilities should be either declined or  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  6    deposited to the Organization's bank account in consultation with the Office of the  Controller.  5.4 In cases where possible conflicts of interest might arise, the Ethics Office shall  be consulted.  5.5 In the event that approval is not granted, the staff member shall decline the  honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration.        Section 6  Final provisions    6.1 Information circular ST/IC/2006/31 of 16 August 2006, entitled ""Honours,  gifts or remuneration from outside sources"", is hereby abolished.  6.2 The present instruction shall enter into force on the date of its issuance.

In accordance with financial rule 105.13 (c), where  the advice of a review committee is required, no final action leading to the award or  amendment of a procurement contract may be taken before such advice is received.  4.2  The review committees are an integral part of internal controls and serve as  advisory bodies to the authorized officials in discharging their procurement-related  responsibilities under the Financial Regulations and Rules.   __________________    1  Pursuant to a delegation of authority, the Under-Secretary-General for Field Support is authorized  to establish review committees in peacekeeping and political missions administratively supported  by the Department of Field Support by applying the provisions in the present instruction.

"accountability","ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1          United Nations  Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  including provisional Staff Rules,  of the United Nations        Secretary-General's bulletin                ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  including provisional Staff Rules,  of the United Nations        Secretary-General's bulletin            ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    United Nations  New York, 2023      23-12028  3/115    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1  1 January 2023         Secretary-General's bulletin         Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, including provisional  Staff Rules         Under Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, the General Assembly  establishes staff regulations which set out the broad principles of human resources  policy for the staffing and administration of the Secretariat and the separately  administered funds and programmes. The Secretary-General is required by the staff  regulations to provide and enforce such staff rules, consistent with these principles,  as the Secretary-General considers necessary.    Articles 8, 97, 100, 101 and 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, which  relate to the service of the staff, are included in the introductory part of the present  edition of the Staff Regulations and Rules, including provisional Staff Rules, on page 6.     The Secretary-General, pursuant to staff regulations 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and  12.5, promulgated provisional Staff Rules of the United Nations, effective 1 January  2023, and further promulgates: (a) the updated pensionable remuneration scales in  appendix A to the Staff Rules, as described in section 2.3 below, effective as from  1 February 2023; and (b) limited technical changes to the Staff Rules, provisionally  effective as from 1 January 2023.1          Section 1     Provisional Staff Rules       1.1 The provisional Staff Rules introduce gender-inclusive language in accordance  with resolution 72/147 of 19 December 2017, in which the General Assembly  reaffirmed the important role of UN-Women in leading, coordinating and  promoting accountability of the United Nations system in its work on gender  equality and the empowerment of women. Additional editorial changes were  made to simplify and streamline the provisional Staff Rules, to improve the user- friendliness and clarity of the text, and to eliminate duplication.   1.2 In provisional staff rule 1.2 (Basic rights and obligations of staff), paragraph  (e), on specific instances of prohibited conduct, the reference to the marriage of  a staff member with a person who is under the age of 18 but over the age of  majority or consent in his or her country of citizenship was removed in line with  General Assembly resolution 73/153 on child, early and forced marriage, in  which the Assembly called upon States to develop and implement measures at  all levels to end child, early and forced marriage.  1.3 New provisional rule 1.3 (Employment and accessibility for staff members with  disabilities) was added. The provisional rule is in accordance with General  Assembly resolution 73/273 and is based on the elements currently included in  the Secretary-General's bulletin on employment and accessibility for staff  members with disabilities in the United Nations Secretariat (ST/SGB/2014/3).   __________________    1  Staff rules 3.9 (g), 6.2 (e), 8.1 (e), 11.4 (b) and appendices A-C.      4/115  23-12028    1.4 Provisional rule 3.3 (Salary policy) was modified to ensure that salary steps in  grade are determined in a consistent manner regardless of whether the staff  member changes category, is appointed or is selected for a new position at a  higher level within the same category.  1.5 New provisional rule 3.7 (Rental subsidy) was added for the purposes of  additional consistency and clarity in the Staff Rules.  1.6 New provisional rule 3.16 (Deductions and contributions), paragraph (c), was  added to provide a clearer basis for the Organization to make voluntary  deductions in accordance with the amounts reflected in family support court  orders in cases in which staff members have failed to meet those obligations.   1.7 Provisional rule 4.4 (Staff in posts subject to local recruitment), paragraph (b),  on the recruitment of National Professional Officers, reflects the increased  flexibility in the use of National Professional Officers in accordance with the  guidelines approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 72/255.  1.8 Provisional rule 6.3 (Parental leave) reflects a change in the parental leave  entitlement pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/256 to replace the  current maternity, paternity and adoption leave provisions with a parental leave  provision of 16 weeks for all parents; and to provide an additional period of 10  weeks for the parent who gives birth.  1.9 Provisional rule 7.2 (Official travel of staff members and their eligible family  members), paragraph (c), allows staff members and their eligible family  members to repatriate to either the place of recruitment or the recognized place  of home leave, provided that the staff members hold an appointment other than  a temporary one and regardless of the duration of their appointment of service  with the Organization.  1.10 Provisional rule 7.3 (Dates, mode, route and standard of travel), paragraph (f),  reflects that, for all official travel by air, the Deputy Secretary-General, the  Under-Secretaries-General and the Assistant Secretaries-General and their  eligible family members shall be provided with a standard of travel immediately  below first class in accordance with General Assembly resolution 72/262 B,  unless economy class transportation is otherwise provided for under conditions  established by the Secretary-General.  1.11 Under provisional rule 9.8 (Termination indemnity), paragraph (c), a  termination indemnity is payable to staff members whose normal age of  retirement is 60 or 62 and whose appointments are terminated as a result of  abolition of posts or reduction of staff prior to their mandatory age of separation  of 65 years. This is a direct consequence of implementing the new mandatory  age of separation of 65 years effective 1 January 2018 as decided by the General  Assembly in its resolution 70/244.          Section 2     Updates to the scales on salary and pensionable remuneration, and  pay protection measures      2.1 By its resolution 77/256 A-B, the General Assembly approved an update of the  salary scale and pay protection measures for staff in the Professional and higher  categories, as set out in annex I to the Staff Regulations.       23-12028  5/115    2.2 The salary scale and pay protection measures for staff in the Field Service  category, as set out in appendix A to the Staff Rules, were updated pursuant to  General Assembly resolution 77/256 A-B.   2.3 The pensionable remuneration scales in appendix A to the Staff Rules were also  updated in accordance with the regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff  Pension Fund.          Section 3     Final provisions       3.1 The provisional Rules shall remain provisional until the requirements of staff  regulations 12.3 and 12.4 have been met.   3.2 The present bulletin supersedes Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2023/1.

They represent  the broad principles of human resources policy for the staffing and administration of  the Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions ""United  Nations Secretariat"", ""staff members"" or ""staff"" shall refer to all the staff members of  the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations,  whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of appointment  subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101,  paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer,  shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with these principles as the  Secretary-General considers necessary.  ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1      10/115  23-12028       Article I     Duties, obligations and privileges          Regulation 1.1      Status of staff      (a)  Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as  staff members are not national but exclusively international;    (b)  Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by  the Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative:      ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or  other source external to the Organization.      ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent  upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""    (c)  The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff  members, as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the  relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected;    (d)  The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount  consideration in the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity  of securing staff of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity;    (e)  The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the  separately funded organs, holding appointments under the Staff Rules;    (f)  The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of  Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These  privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered by  them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are  located, nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private  obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these  privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to  the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and immunities  exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant instruments.        Regulation 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff         Core values      (a)  Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the  Charter, including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the  human person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff  members shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any  individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested  in them;    (b)  Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency,  competence and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to,    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  11/115    probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their  work and status;        General rights and obligations      (c)  Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to  assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations.

(d)  Disciplinary procedures may be instituted against staff members who fail  to comply with their obligations and the standards of conduct set out in the Charter  of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial Regulations and  Rules and administrative issuances.        Specific instances of prohibited conduct      (e)  Both sexual exploitation and sexual abuse are prohibited. Sexual activity  with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age of  majority or the age of consent locally. Mistaken belief in the age of a child is not a  defence.

(k)  Staff members shall neither offer nor promise any favour, gift,  remuneration or any other personal benefit to another staff member or to any third  party with a view to causing that staff member or third party to perform, fail to  perform or delay the performance of any official act.

If circumstances do not  allow for prior approval or if refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour  or gift, including a minor gift of essentially nominal value, would cause  embarrassment to the Organization, staff members may receive it on behalf of the  Organization provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General  through established procedures.    (m) The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to accept from a  non-governmental source or a university or a related institution, academic awards,  distinctions and tokens of a commemorative or honorary character, such as scrolls,  certificates, trophies or other items of essentially nominal monetary value.

Rule 3.2      Salary step increments      (a)  Satisfactory service for the purpose of awarding a salary step increment  shall be defined, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary-General in any particular  case, by satisfactory performance and conduct of staff members.    (b)  Salary step increments shall be effective on the first day of the pay period  in which the service requirements are completed. No step increment shall be paid in  the case of staff members whose services will cease during the month in which the  step increment would otherwise have been due.    (c)  If a staff member with satisfactory service changes level downwards, the  period of service since the last step increment shall be credited towards the next step  increment within the lower level.     (d)  If a staff member whose service has not been satisfactory is demoted to a  lower level, the staff member's eligibility for salary step increment in the lower level  will be based on satisfactory service at the lower level.        Rule 3.3      Salary policy      (a)  On appointment, or on selection to a different category, staff members  shall normally be placed at the first step of the level of their post, unless otherwise  decided by the Secretary-General.

Contributions payable in  accordance with article 25 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff  Pension Fund shall be based on either:    (i)  The pensionable remuneration of the staff member used to determine such  contributions at the time of change in category; or    (ii) The pensionable remuneration applicable to the staff member's grade and  step in the Professional category;  whichever is higher.

The child is under the age of 18 years;      b.  The child is between the ages of 18 and 21 years and attends  university or its equivalent full-time; the requirement of residing with the staff  member does not apply in this case;      c.  The child is of any age and has a disability as medically determined  by the Secretary-General as being permanent or for a period that is expected to  be long-term that prevents substantial gainful employment;    (iv) Staff members claiming a child as a dependant must certify that they  provide main and continuous support. This certification must be supported by  documentary evidence under conditions established by the Secretary-General,  if a child:      a.   Does not reside with the staff member;      b.   Is married; or      c.

Where such a  governmental grant is made, the dependent child allowance or single parent  allowance payable under this rule shall be the approximate amount by which the  governmental grant is less than the dependent child allowance or single parent  allowance set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules. No dependency  allowance is payable if the governmental grant is equal to or exceeds the rate  set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules;    (iv) Secondary dependent allowance: a secondary dependency allowance shall  be paid in respect of not more than one secondary dependent and such payment  shall not be made when a payment is being made for a dependent spouse.

(b)  While the salaries of staff members in the Professional and higher  categories and in the Field Service category are normally subject to the post  adjustment of their duty station during assignments for one year or more, alternative  arrangements may be made by the Secretary-General under the following  circumstances:    (i)  When staff members are assigned to a duty station whose post adjustment  classification is lower than that of their previous duty station, they may continue  to receive for up to six months the post adjustment applicable to the previous  duty station while at least one member of their immediate family (spouse and  children) remains at that duty station;    (ii) When staff members are assigned for three months or less to a United  Nations field mission or for less than six months elsewhere, the Secretary- General shall decide whether to apply the post adjustment applicable to the duty  station and to pay entitlements applicable when there is a change of official duty  station or, in lieu of the above, to authorize appropriate payments of the daily  subsistence allowance.        Rule 3.7      Rental subsidy      (a)  Internationally recruited staff members who incur higher-than-average  rent costs for reasonable standard accommodations will be paid a supplement to the  post adjustment in the form of a rental subsidy under conditions established by the  Secretary-General.

Duration      (d)  The duration as regulated under staff regulation 3.2 on the education grant  may be extended if the child's education is interrupted for at least one school year by  mandatory national service, illness or other compelling reasons.

(c)  In the case of a staff member holding a fixed-term or continuing  appointment who is assigned to serve in a mission, or when a staff member in the  General Service category is required to serve in a higher-level post in the Professional  category, or when a staff member in any category holding a fixed-term or continuing  appointment is required to serve in a post which is classified more than one level  above the staff member's level, the allowance may be paid immediately when the staff  member assumes the higher duties and responsibilities.    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  31/115      (d)  The amount of the special post allowance shall be equivalent to the salary  increase (including post adjustment and dependency allowances, if any) which the  staff member would have received had the staff member been promoted to the next  higher level.        Rule 3.11      Mobility incentive      (a)  The purpose of the mobility incentive is to encourage movement of staff  members to duty stations classified as A to E in accordance with the classification of  duty stations established by the International Civil Service Commission.

(d)  The amount of the mobility incentive, if any, and the conditions under  which it will be paid, shall be determined after taking into account the number of duty  stations at which staff members have previously served for a period of one year or  longer and the hardship classification of the new duty station to which staff members  are assigned.        Rule 3.12      Hardship allowance      (a)  The purpose of the hardship allowance is to compensate for the hardship  experienced by staff members serving in duty stations classified as B to E by the  International Civil Service Commission.

(c)  Administrative leave shall be with full pay except (i) in cases where there  are reasonable grounds to believe that a staff member engaged in sexual exploitation  and/or sexual abuse, in which case the placement of the staff member on  administrative leave shall be without pay, or (ii) when the Secretary-General decides  that exceptional circumstances exist which warrant the placement of a staff member  on administrative leave with partial pay or without pay.     (d)  Placement on administrative leave shall be without prejudice to the rights  of the staff member and shall not constitute a disciplinary measure. If administrative  leave is with partial pay or without pay and the staff member's conduct at issue does  not lead to the imposition of the disciplinary measure of dismissal or separation from  service, any pay withheld shall be restored without delay.    (e)  A staff member who has been placed on administrative leave may  challenge the decision to place him or her on such leave in accordance with chapter XI  (Appeals) of the Staff Rules.

To that end, a staff member who wishes to pursue informal  channels should approach the Office of the Ombudsman without delay, without  prejudice to the right to pursue the matter formally in accordance with the provisions  of the present chapter.     (b)  Both the staff member and the Secretary-General may initiate informal  resolution, including mediation, of the issues involved at any time before or after the  staff member chooses to pursue the matter formally.    (c)  The conduct of informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman,  including mediation, may result in the extension of the deadlines applicable to  management evaluation and to the filing of an application with the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal, as specified in staff rules 11.2 (c) and (d) and 11.4 (c) below.     (d)  An application shall not be receivable by the United Nations Dispute  Tribunal if the dispute arising from a contested decision has been resolved by an  agreement reached through mediation. However, a staff member may submit an  application directly with the Dispute Tribunal to enforce the implementation of an  agreement reached through mediation within 90 calendar days of the deadline for  implementation as specified in the mediation agreement or, when the mediation  agreement is silent on the matter, within 90 calendar days of the thirtieth calendar day  from the date on which the agreement was signed.        Rule 11.2      Management evaluation      (a)  Staff members wishing to formally contest an administrative decision  alleging non-compliance with their contract of employment or terms of appointment,  including all pertinent regulations and rules pursuant to staff regulation 11.1 (a), shall,  as a first step, submit to the Secretary-General in writing a request for a management  evaluation of the administrative decision.    (b)  A staff member wishing to formally contest an administrative decision  taken pursuant to advice obtained from a duly designated technical body, as  determined by the Secretary-General, or of a decision taken at Headquarters in New  York to impose a disciplinary or non-disciplinary measure pursuant to staff rule 10.2  (Disciplinary measures) following the completion of a disciplinary process is not  required to request a management evaluation.    (c)  A request for a management evaluation shall not be receivable by the  Secretary-General unless it is sent within 60 calendar days from the date on which  the staff member received notification of the administrative decision to be contested.  This deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for informal  resolution conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by  the Secretary-General.    (d)  The Secretary-General's response, reflecting the outcome of the  management evaluation, shall be communicated in writing to the staff member within  30 calendar days of receipt of the request for management evaluation if the staff  member is stationed in New York, and within 45 calendar days of receipt of the  ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1      80/115  23-12028    request for management evaluation if the staff member is stationed outside of New  York. The deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for  informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by  the Secretary-General.        Rule 11.3      Suspension of action      (a)  Neither the submission of a request for a management evaluation nor the  filing of an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal shall have the effect  of suspending the implementation of the contested administrative decision.     (b)  However, where a management evaluation of an administrative decision is  required:    (i)  A staff member may submit an application requesting the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal to suspend the implementation of the contested administrative  decision until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff  member has received notification of the outcome. In accordance with article 2,  paragraph 2, of its statute, the Dispute Tribunal may suspend the implementation  of a decision where the decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of  particular urgency and where its implementation would cause irreparable  damage. The Dispute Tribunal's decision on such an application is not subject  to appeal;    (ii) In cases involving separation from service, a staff member may opt to first  request the Secretary-General to suspend the implementation of the decision  until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff member has  received notification of the outcome. The Secretary-General, after determining  that the decision has not yet been implemented, may suspend its implementation  where it appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular urgency and  where its implementation would cause irreparable damage to the staff member's  rights. If the Secretary-General rejects the request, the staff member may then  submit a request for suspension of action to the Dispute Tribunal under  subparagraph (b) (i) above.        Rule 11.4      United Nations Dispute Tribunal      (a)  A staff member may file an application against a contested administrative  decision, whether or not it has been amended by any management evaluation, with  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which  the staff member received the outcome of the management evaluation or from the date  of expiration of the deadline specified under staff rule 11.2 (d), whichever is earlier.    (b)  When staff members are not required to request a management evaluation,  pursuant to staff rule 11.2 (b), they may file an application directly with the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which they  received notification of the contested administrative decision.    (c)  Where mediation has been pursued by either party within the deadline for  filing an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal specified in staff  rule 11.4 (a) or (b) and the mediation is deemed to have failed in accordance with the  rules of procedure of the Mediation Division of the Office of the Ombudsman, the  staff member may file an application with the Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar  days of the end of the mediation.    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  81/115      (d)  Staff members shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of  Staff Legal Assistance if they so wish, or may retain outside counsel at their own  expense, in the presentation of their case before the United Nations Dispute Tribunal.    (e)  A staff association may request permission from the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in relation to an application  filed by a staff member.    (f)  A staff member who is entitled to appeal the same administrative decision  that is the subject of an application brought by another staff member may request  permission from the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to intervene in the matter.    (g)  In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal has jurisdiction over an application filed by a staff member:    (i)  To appeal an administrative decision that is alleged to not be in compliance  with a staff member's contract of employment or terms of appointment,  including all pertinent regulations and rules and all relevant administrative  issuances in force at the time of the alleged non-compliance;    (ii) To appeal an administrative decision imposing a disciplinary measure;    (iii) To enforce the implementation of an agreement reached through  mediation.     (h)  The competence of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, as set forth in its  statute, includes the authority:    (i)  To suspend proceedings in a case at the request of the parties for a time to  be specified by it in writing;    (ii) To order, at any time during the proceedings, an interim measure, which is  not subject to appeal, to provide temporary relief to either party where the  contested decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular  urgency, and where its implementation would cause irreparable damage. Such  temporary relief may include suspension of the implementation of the contested  administrative decision, except in cases of appointment, promotion or  termination;    (iii) To refer, at any time during its deliberations, a matter to mediation with  the consent of both parties.        Rule 11.5      United Nations Appeals Tribunal      (a)  In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations  Appeals Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over an appeal against a judgment of the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal alleging that the Dispute Tribunal has:     (i)  Exceeded its jurisdiction or competence;     (ii) Failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in it;     (iii) Erred on a question of law;     (iv) Committed an error in procedure, such as to affect the decision of the case;  or     (v)  Erred on a question of fact, resulting in a manifestly unreasonable  decision.   ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1      82/115  23-12028      (b)  An appeal may be filed by either party against the judgment of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal within 60 calendar days following receipt of the Dispute  Tribunal's judgment. An appeal shall not be receivable by the United Nations Appeals  Tribunal unless the deadline has been met or has been waived or suspended by the  Appeals Tribunal.    (c)  The filing of an appeal with the United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall  have the effect of suspending the execution of a judgment of the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal that is contested.     (d)  Staff members shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of  Staff Legal Assistance if they so wish or may retain outside counsel at their own  expense in the presentation of their case before the United Nations Appeals Tribunal.    (e)  The competence of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, as set forth in its  statute, includes the authority:    (i)  To decide, at its own initiative or at the request of either party, that  exceptional circumstances require the proceedings to be closed;    (ii) To order an interim measure to provide temporary relief to either party to  prevent irreparable harm and to maintain consistency with the judgment of the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal.

In exceptional cases and at the discretion of the Secretary-General, the lump- sum boarding assistance may be granted to a staff member at a headquarters duty  station in respect of a child boarding to attend school at the primary and secondary  levels outside the duty station.    (c)  The lump-sum amount for boarding assistance shall also be payable to a  staff member serving at a duty station classified as ""A"" to ""E"" by the International  Civil Service Commission whose child is boarding to attend school at the primary or  secondary level when the educational institution is located beyond commuting  distance from the area where the staff member is serving and, in the opinion of the  Secretary-General, no school in that area would be suitable for the child.         Special education grant      (d)  Under conditions established by the Secretary-General, admissible  expenses for a child with a disability shall include those educational expenses  required to provide an educational programme designed to meet the needs of the child  so that the child may attain the highest level of functional ability.

(e)  When boarding is provided, the actual expenses shall be included in the  calculation of the admissible expenses, subject to a maximum reimbursement equal to  the upper limit of the top bracket of the sliding scale in paragraph (a) above plus the  amount of 5,300 United States dollars, equivalent to the lump sum for boarding  assistance.    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1      100/115  23-12028    Appendix C       Arrangements relating to military service         (a)  In accordance with section 18 (c) of the Convention on Privileges and  Immunities of the United Nations, staff members who are nationals of those Member  States which have acceded to that Convention shall be ""immune from national service  obligations"" in the armed services of the country of their nationality.     (b)  Any requests to Governments which have not acceded to the Convention  to defer or exempt staff members from military service by reason of their employment  with the United Nations shall be made by the Secretary-General and not by the staff  member concerned.     (c)  Staff members who have successfully passed a competitive examination  and have completed one year of satisfactory service under a fixed-term appointment  or who have a continuing appointment may, if called by a Member Government for  military service, whether for training or active duty, be placed on special leave  without pay for the duration of their required military service. Other staff members,  if called for military service, shall be separated from the Secretariat according to the  terms of their appointments.     (d)  A staff member called for military service who is placed on special leave  without pay shall have the terms of appointment maintained as they were on the last  day of service before the staff member went on leave without pay. The staff member's  re-employment in the Secretariat shall be guaranteed, subject only to the normal rules  governing necessary reductions in force or abolition of posts.     (e)  In the interpretation of staff rule 9.6 (c), the period of special leave without  pay for military service shall be counted for the purpose of establishing seniority.     (f)  A staff member on special leave without pay for military service shall be  required to advise the Secretary-General within 90 days after release from military  service if the staff member wishes to be restored to active duty with the Secretariat.  The staff member shall also be required to submit a certificate of completion of  military service.     (g)  If a staff member, after the period of required military service, elects to  continue such service or if the staff member fails to obtain a certified release  therefrom, the Secretary-General will determine, on the merits of the particular case,  whether further special leave without pay will be granted and whether re employment  rights shall be maintained.     (h)  If the staff member's absence on special leave without pay appears likely  to last six months or more, the United Nations will pay, if so requested, for  transporting the staff member's spouse and dependent children to the staff member's  place of entitlement and for their return travel after the staff member's return to active  duty with the Secretariat, provided that the expenses involved will be counted as  travel expenses related to the next home leave entitlement of the staff member.     (i)  The United Nations shall not continue its contribution to the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund on behalf of the staff member during the staff  member's absence on special leave without pay for military service.     (j)  The provisions of staff rule 6.4 relating to death, injury or illness  attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations shall  not be applicable during periods of military service.     ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  101/115      (k)  The Secretary-General may, if the circumstances of the military service  appear to warrant it, credit the staff member's period on special leave without pay for  military service in fixing the salary step upon the staff member's return to active duty  with the Secretariat.     (l)  The Secretary-General may apply such of the foregoing provisions as are  appropriate in the case of a staff member who, with the advance approval of the  Secretary-General, volunteers for military service or requests a waiver of immunity  under section 18 (c) of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United  Nations.       ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1      102/115  23-12028    Appendix D        Rules governing compensation in the event of death, injury or  illness attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf  of the United Nations          Section I      Scope and general provisions           Article 1.1       Purpose and scope       The present rules provide for compensation for death, injury or illness  attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations, as  set out below. Compensation shall be provided solely to staff members and their  dependants, in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the present  rules.         Article 1.2       Exclusiveness of remedy; non-assignment       Compensation or other forms of recourse provided under the present rules  constitute the sole remedy for service-incurred death, injury or illness. The United  Nations will not accept, consider or provide compensation or benefits for service- incurred death, injury or illness except under the present rules. Except as set forth  below, compensation and rights shall not be assignable to third parties.         Article 1.3       Terminology       The following terminology applies for the purposes of the present rules:     (a)  Claimant: the staff member or dependant, as defined below, bringing a  claim under these rules.     (b)  Dependant: the spouse, dependent child or secondary dependant as set  forth in the Staff Rules. Compensation payable on the basis of or benefit payable to a  dependent child or secondary dependent sibling ceases on the day the dependent child  or secondary dependent sibling reaches the age of 18, or 21 if the dependent child or  secondary dependent sibling is attending university or its equivalent full-time. This  restriction does not apply where and as long as the dependent child or secondary  dependent sibling has a disability that is permanent or for a period that is expected to  be long-term that prevents gainful employment.     (c)  Minor: an individual under the age of 18, or the age of majority under the  laws of the country of residence of such individual, if the age of majority in the  individual's country of residency is less than 18 years of age.     (d)  Illness: a deterioration in health as confirmed by a physician authorized to  practise medicine by a competent authority.     (e)  Injury: a physiological impairment as confirmed by a physician authorized  to practise medicine by a competent authority.     (f)  Incident: an event causing the death, injury or illness underlying a claim.     (g)  Commute or commuting: travel by reasonable means of transportation and  on a direct route, by time or distance, between place of work and residence. A direct  route is deemed to commence upon departure from, or be terminated on arrival at,    ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  103/115    United Nations premises or the property line at the designated place of work or the  property line of the staff member's place of residence, such residence including yards,  lawns, driveways, garages, stairways, entrances, elevators, basements, hallways or  common areas, without deliberate deviation from such route.     (h)  Reasonable means of transportation: a generally accepted means of  transportation under the circumstances. Transportation by a particularly hazardous  means is not considered a reasonable means of transportation for the purposes of the  present rules.     (i)  Service-incurred death, injury or illness: a death, injury or illness where  the death, injury or illness is directly attributable to the performance of official duties  on behalf of the United Nations under the terms and conditions set out in the present  rules.     (j)  Pensionable remuneration: the definition of pensionable remuneration is  set out in article 51 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.  If the staff member was not a participant in the Fund at the date of the staff member's  death, injury or illness, remuneration shall be that which, had the staff member been  a participant, would have been considered the staff member's pensionable  remuneration at that date.     (k)  Last pensionable remuneration: the pensionable remuneration at the time  of (i) the incident, in the case of permanent disfigurement or permanent loss of  function; (ii) the separation from service, in the case of total disability; or (iii) the  date of death, in the case of death. If the staff member was not a participant in the  United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund at the date of the staff member's death, injury  or illness, the remuneration shall be that which, had the staff member been a  participant, would have been considered the staff member's pensionable remuneration  at that date.

Article 1.4       Advisory Board on Compensation Claims       (a)  The Secretary-General has established the Advisory Board on  Compensation Claims to consider claims for compensation arising from a service- incurred death, injury or illness and to make recommendations thereon to the  Secretary-General.     (b)  The Board may adopt procedures as it considers necessary for discharging  its functions under the present article, provided that, in cases of conflict, the present  rules prevail.

Article 1.5       Secretary of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims       (a)  The Secretary of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims shall be  designated by the Secretary-General or other authorized official. The Secretary may  not, at the same time, be a member of the Board.     (b)  The Secretary of the Board is responsible for preparing claims submitted  under the present rules for consideration by the Board or the official with delegated  authority to consider de minimis claims, as set forth in article 1.6 below. In  discharging the functions and responsibilities under these rules, the Secretary will  seek to obtain sufficient and relevant documentary evidence from appropriate sources.         Article 1.6       De minimis claims       If it is determined that: (a) the potential cumulative cost to the United Nations  of a claim is less than an amount determined by the Secretary-General or officials  with delegated authority; and (b) the claim is solely for reimbursement of medical  expenses, funeral expenses, compensation for permanent disfigurement or loss of  function, or granting of sick leave credit, the official with delegated authority to  consider such de minimis claims may make determinations on the compensability of  a claim, without the consideration of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims.  If the official with delegated authority to consider de minimis claims makes a  determination on a claim, and the claim later exceeds the amount for de minimis  claims, the claim shall be presented to the Board for new consideration.         Article 1.7       Role of the Medical Services Division       (a)  The Medical Services Division shall make a medical determination for  consideration by the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims or the official with  delegated authority to consider de minimis claims. Such a determination may include:     (i)  Whether a death, injury or illness is directly causatively related to an incident;     (ii) Whether a death, injury or illness is directly causatively related to the  performance of official duties;     ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  105/115      (iii) Whether treatment or services are directly related to a service-incurred  injury or illness;     (iv) Whether treatment or services are reasonably necessary for the treatment  of such an injury or illness;     (v)  Whether medical expenses are at a reasonable cost for the treatment or  services provided;     (vi) Whether absence from work is directly related to a service-incurred injury  or illness;     (vii) Whether a claimant has reached maximum medical improvement, in order  to assess a permanent loss of function;     (viii) Permanent disfigurement or loss of function;     (ix) Total disability.     (b)  In accordance with staff rule 6.2 (h), a staff member may be required to  undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner designated by the United  Nations Medical Director, with the cost to be borne by the Organization, in order to  clarify findings or to further assess the claim in connection with any of the  determinations made pursuant to the present article. A staff member may also be  required to provide further information in connection with any of the determinations  made pursuant to the present article.

(b)  When made by staff members, such claims may constitute misconduct  under chapter X of the Staff Rules, and may result in disciplinary measures.

(b)  The Advisory Board on Compensation Claims will assess whether the  death, injury or illness is service-incurred and provide its recommendation on a claim  to the Secretary-General. For de minimis claims, the official with delegated authority  to consider de minimis claims will assess whether the death, injury or illness is  service-incurred and take a decision on the claim on behalf of the Secretary-General.     (c)  Such an assessment will be based on the claimant's submissions, and, as  appropriate, the recommendations of the Medical Services Division, technical advice  from ex officio members of the Board and any other relevant documentary or other  evidence.         Service-incurred death, injury or illness       (d)  A death, injury or illness is service-incurred if it is directly attributable to  the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations, in that it occurred  while engaged in activities and at a place required for the performance of official duties.     (i)  Incidents on the United Nations premises: if an incident occurs on United  Nations premises, the resulting injury, illness or death may be service-incurred,  unless at the time of the incident the staff member is engaged in an activity  outside the scope of the staff member's official duties;     (ii) Incidents off the United Nations premises: if an incident occurs away from  the United Nations premises, the resulting injury, illness or death may be  service-incurred if such death, injury or illness would not have occurred but for  the performance of official duties, and if the incident occurred in any of the  following circumstances:       a.

Such a grant is limited to the maximum extent of the prior sick leave  used for the separate service-incurred injury or illness. No credit will be granted  for any sick leave already revived under the time frames of staff rule 6.2 (c);    (ii)  To maintain the full pay status of a staff member being considered for a  disability benefit pursuant to article 33 (a) of the Regulations of the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, who has exhausted the sick leave entitlement.

If such travel is commenced  or terminated within 12 months of the staff member's eligibility for home leave  entitlement pursuant to staff rule 5.4 and chapter VII of the Staff Rules, such special  travel allowance shall be deemed to be in lieu of the staff member's home leave  entitlement. If the staff member does not return to duty, such special travel allowance  shall be deemed to be in lieu of travel on separation pursuant to chapter VII of the  Staff Rules.

Future claims       (f)  Any amount of compensation that a claimant may be entitled to receive in  the future pursuant to the present rules shall be first used to offset any monies received  by the claimant under subparagraph (e) (iii) above.         Article 4.2       Recovery of overpayments       (a)  If the United Nations has paid a claimant in excess of any compensation  payable under the present rules, the United Nations will notify the claimant of the  amount of overpayment and request reimbursement.     (b)  If immediate reimbursement in full is not feasible, any future periodic  payments of compensation payable to the claimant under the present rules shall be  reduced by 20 per cent until the overpayment has been reimbursed in full. If immediate  reimbursement in full of any lump-sum payment made under the present rules is not  feasible, the Secretary-General will seek recovery by means including, but not limited  to, the reduction of any future lump sum payments of compensation payable to the  claimant under the present rules by the entire amount of the overpayment.          Section V      Reconsideration, review and appeal           Article 5.1       Reconsideration of medical determinations       Claimants wishing to contest a decision taken on a claim under the present rules,  when that decision is based upon a medical determination by the Medical Services  Division or the United Nations Medical Director, shall submit a request for  reconsideration of the medical determination under conditions, and by a technical  body, established by the Secretary-General.       ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1    23-12028  115/115        Article 5.2       Review and appeal of administrative decisions       Claimants wishing to contest a decision taken on a claim under the present rules,  to the extent that the decision was based on considerations other than a medical  determination, shall submit to the Secretary-General a written request for  management evaluation in accordance with staff rule 11.2.         Article 5.3       Reopening of claims       Upon a written request by a claimant, or at the initiative of the Secretary- General, a claim made under the present rules may be reopened when one or more of  the following criteria are met:     (a)  The discovery of new material evidence, if such new material evidence  may materially affect:     (i)   A determination as to whether a death, injury or illness was service- incurred; or     (ii)  A relevant medical determination;     (b)  A worsening or improvement in the condition of the staff member, where  such worsening or improvement is directly related to the service-incurred injury or  illness, and which may entitle the staff member to additional compensation, or  warrant the reduction or elimination of compensation;     (c)  A material mistake was made by the United Nations in the processing of a  claim that had an impact on its disposition.     When a claim is reopened subject to the provisions above, any such claim shall  be considered in accordance with the present rules. The Secretary-General and the  claimant shall be bound by determinations previously made, unless new material  evidence or material mistake undermines or otherwise calls into question in  substantial part those determinations.

"accountability","ST/SGB/2023/1          United Nations  Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  including provisional Staff Rules,  of the United Nations        Secretary-General's bulletin                ST/SGB/2023/1    Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  including provisional Staff Rules,  of the United Nations        Secretary-General's bulletin              ST/SGB/2023/1    United Nations  New York, 2023      22-28707  3/116    ST/SGB/2023/1  1 January 2023         Secretary-General's bulletin         Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, including provisional  Staff Rules         Under Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, the General Assembly  establishes staff regulations which set out the broad principles of human resources  policy for the staffing and administration of the Secretariat and the separately  administered funds and programmes. The Secretary-General is required by the staff  regulations to provide and enforce such staff rules, consistent with these principles,  as the Secretary-General considers necessary.    The Secretary-General, pursuant to staff regulations 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and  12.5, promulgates the following with respect to the Staff Regulations and Rules 1 of  the United Nations effective as from 1 January 2023, and hereby promulgates the  following with respect to the provisional Staff Rules, provisionally effective as from  1 January 2023.     Articles 8, 97, 100, 101 and 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, which relate  to the service of the staff, are included in the introductory part of the present edition of  the Staff Regulations and Rules, including provisional Staff Rules, on page 6.          Section 1     Provisional Staff Rules       1.1 The provisional Staff Rules introduce gender-inclusive language in accordance  with resolution 72/147 of 19 December 2017, in which the General Assembly  reaffirmed the important role of UN-Women in leading, coordinating and  promoting accountability of the United Nations system in its work on gender  equality and the empowerment of women. Additional editorial changes were  made to simplify and streamline the provisional Staff Rules, to improve the user- friendliness and clarity of the text, and to eliminate duplication.   1.2 In provisional staff rule 1.2 (Basic rights and obligations of staff), paragraph (e),  on specific instances of prohibited conduct, the reference to the marriage of a  staff member with a person who is under the age of 18 but over the age of  majority or consent in his or her country of citizenship was removed in line with  General Assembly resolution 73/153 on child, early and forced marriage, in  which the Assembly called upon States to develop and implement measures at  all levels to end child, early and forced marriage.  1.3 New provisional rule 1.3 (Employment and accessibility for staff members with  disabilities) was added. The provisional rule is in accordance with General  Assembly resolution 73/273 and is based on the elements currently included in  the Secretary-General's bulletin on employment and accessibility for staff  members with disabilities in the United Nations Secretariat (ST/SGB/2014/3).   __________________    1  Staff rules 1.7, 3.17, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.11, 4.12, 4.14, 6.4-6.6, 7.4, 8.2, 9.1, 9.4, 12.2 and 13.5 and  appendices A and C.      4/116  22-28707    1.4 Provisional rule 3.3 (Salary policy) was modified to ensure that salary steps in  grade are determined in a consistent manner regardless of whether the staff  member changes category, is appointed or is selected for a new position at a  higher level within the same category.  1.5 New provisional rule 3.7 (Rental subsidy) was added for the purposes of  additional consistency and clarity in the Staff Rules.  1.6 New provisional rule 3.16 (Deductions and contributions), paragraph (c), was  added to provide a clearer basis on which the Organization may make voluntary  deductions in accordance with the amounts reflected in family support court  orders in cases in which staff members have failed to meet those obligations.  1.7 Provisional rule 4.4 (Staff in posts subject to local recruitment), paragraph (b),  on the recruitment of National Professional Officers, reflects the increased  flexibility in the use of National Professional Officers in accordance with the  guidelines approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 72/255.  1.8 Provisional rule 6.3 (Parental leave) reflects a change in the parental leave  entitlement pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/256 to replace the  current maternity, paternity and adoption leave provisions with a parental leave  provision of 16 weeks for all parents; and to provide an additional period of 10  weeks for the parent who gives birth.  1.9 Provisional rule 7.2 (Official travel of staff members and their eligible family  members), paragraph (c), allows staff members and their eligible family  members to repatriate to either the place of recruitment or the recognized place  of home leave, provided that the staff members hold an appointment other than  a temporary one and regardless of the duration of their appointment of service  with the Organization.  1.10 Provisional rule 7.3 (Dates, mode, route and standard of travel), paragraph (f),  reflects that, for all official travel by air, the Deputy Secretary-General, the  Under-Secretaries-General and the Assistant Secretaries-General and their  eligible family members shall be provided with a standard of travel immediately  below first class in accordance with General Assembly resolution 72/262 B,  unless economy class transportation is otherwise provided for under conditions  established by the Secretary-General.  1.11 Under provisional rule 9.8 (Termination indemnity), paragraph (c), a  termination indemnity is payable to staff members whose normal age of  retirement is 60 or 62 and whose appointments are terminated as a result of  abolition of posts or reduction of staff prior to their mandatory age of separation  of 65 years. This is a direct consequence of implementing the new mandatory  age of separation of 65 years effective 1 January 2018 as decided by the General  Assembly in its resolution 70/244.   1.12 By its resolution 77/256, the General Assembly approved an update of the salary  scale and pay protection points for staff in the Professional and higher  categories, as set out in annex I to the Staff Regulations.   1.13 The salary scale and pay protection measures for staff in the Field Service  category as set out in appendix A to the Staff Rules, were updated pursuant to  General Assembly resolution 77/256.          22-28707  5/116       Section 2     Final provisions       2.1 The provisional Rules shall remain provisional until the requirements of staff  regulations 12.3 and 12.4 have been met.   2.2 The present bulletin supersedes Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2018/1/Rev.2.

Article 100      1.  In the performance of their duties, the Secretary-General and the staff shall  not seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other authority  external to the Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect  on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization.    2.  Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to respect the exclusively  international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff  and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities.        Article 101      1.  The staff shall be appointed by the Secretary-General under regulations  established by the General Assembly.    2.  Appropriate staffs shall be permanently assigned to the Economic and  Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and, as required, to other organs of the  United Nations. These staffs shall form a part of the Secretariat.    3.  The paramount consideration in the employment of the staff and in the  determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing the  highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Due regard shall be paid  to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.        Article 105      1.  The Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such  privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes.    2.  Representatives of the Members of the United Nations and officials of the  Organization shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary  for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization.    3.  The General Assembly may make recommendations with a view to  determining the details of the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article or may  propose conventions to the Members of the United Nations for this purpose.        22-28707  7/116        Earlier amendments to the Staff Regulations      The General Assembly established the Staff Regulations of the United Nations  according to Article 101 of the Charter by resolution 590 (VI) of 2 February 1952 and  amended them thereafter by resolutions 781 (VIII) and 782 (VIII) of 9 December  1953, resolution 882 (IX) of 14 December 1954, resolution 887 (IX) of 17 December  1954, resolution 974 (X) of 15 December 1955, resolution 1095 (XI) of 27 February  1957, resolutions 1225 (XII) and 1234 (XII) of 14 December 1957, resolution 1295  (XIII) of 5 December 1958, resolution 1658 (XVI) of 28 November 1961, resolution  1730 (XVI) of 20 December 1961, resolution 1929 (XVIII) of 11 December 1963,  resolution 2050 (XX) of 13 December 1965, resolution 2121 (XX) of 21 December  1965, resolution 2369 (XXII) of 19 December 1967, resolutions 2481 (XXIII) and  2485 (XXIII) of 21 December 1968, resolution 2742 (XXV) of 17 December 1970,  resolution 2888 (XXVI) of 21 December 1971, resolution 2990 (XXVII) of  15 December 1972, resolution 3008 (XXVII) of 18 December 1972, resolution 3194  (XXVIII) of 18 December 1973, resolutions 3353 (XXIX) and 3358 B (XXIX) of  18 December 1974, resolution 31/141 B of 17 December 1976, resolution 32/200 and  decision 32/450 B of 21 December 1977, resolution 33/119 of 19 December 1978,  decision 33/433 of 20 December 1978, resolution 35/214 of 17 December 1980,  decision 36/459 of 18 December 1981, resolution 37/126 of 17 December 1982,  resolution 37/235 C of 21 December 1982, resolution 39/69 of 13 December 1984,  resolutions 39/236 and 39/245 of 18 December 1984, decision 40/467 of 18 December  1985, resolutions 41/207 and 41/209 of 11 December 1986, resolutions 42/221 and  42/225 of 21 December 1987, resolution 43/226 of 21 December 1988, resolution  44/185 of 19 December 1989, resolution 44/198 of 21 December 1989, resolutions  45/241 and 45/251 of 21 December 1990, resolution 45/259 of 3 May 1991, resolution  46/191 of 20 December 1991, resolution 47/216 of 12 March 1993, resolution 47/226  of 30 April 1993, resolutions 48/224 and 48/225 of 23 December 1993, resolutions  49/222 and 49/223 of 23 December 1994, resolution 49/241 of 6 April 1995,  resolution 51/216 of 18 December 1996, resolution 52/216 of 22 December 1997,  resolution 52/225 of 4 February 1998, resolution 52/252 of 8 September 1998,  resolution 54/238 and decision 54/460 of 23 December 1999, resolution 55/223 of  23 December 2000, resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, resolution 56/244 of  24 December 2001, resolution 57/285 of 20 December 2002, resolution 57/310 of  18 June 2003, resolution 58/265 of 23 December 2003, resolution 59/268 of  23 December 2004, resolutions 60/238 and 60/248 of 23 December 2005, resolution  61/239 of 22 December 2006, resolution 62/227 of 22 December 2007, resolution  63/271 of 7 April 2009, resolution 65/248 of 23 December 2010, resolutions 67/254  A and 67/255 of 12 April 2013, resolutions 68/252 and 68/253 of 27 December 2013,  resolution 70/244 of 23 December 2015, resolution 70/256 of 1 April 2016, resolution  71/263 of 23 December 2016, resolution 72/254 of 24 December 2017, resolution  73/273 of 22 December 2018, resolution 74/255 B of 27 December 2019, resolution  75/245 of 31 December 2020, resolution 76/240 of 24 December 2021 and resolution  77/256 of 30 December 2022.          8/116  22-28707    Contents    Article or  chapter  Title  Regulations  Rules  Page    Scope and purpose . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    9  I.

They represent  the broad principles of human resources policy for the staffing and administration of  the Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions ""United  Nations Secretariat"", ""staff members"" or ""staff"" shall refer to all the staff members of  the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations,  whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of appointment  subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101,  paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer,  shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with these principles as the  Secretary-General considers necessary.    ST/SGB/2023/1      10/116  22-28707       Article I     Duties, obligations and privileges          Regulation 1.1      Status of staff      (a)  Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as  staff members are not national but exclusively international;    (b)  Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by  the Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative:      ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or  other source external to the Organization.      ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent  upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""    (c)  The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff  members, as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the  relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected;    (d)  The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount  consideration in the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity  of securing staff of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity;    (e)  The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the  separately funded organs, holding appointments under the Staff Rules;    (f)  The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of  Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These  privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered by  them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are  located, nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private  obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these  privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to  the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and immunities  exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant instruments.        Regulation 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff         Core values      (a)  Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the  Charter, including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the  human person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff  members shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any  individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested  in them;    (b)  Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency,  competence and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to,    ST/SGB/2023/1    11/116  22-28707    probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their  work and status;        General rights and obligations      (c)  Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to  assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In  exercising this authority, the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to  the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for  staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them;    (d)  In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor  accept instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the  Organization;    (e)  By accepting appointment, staff members pledge themselves to discharge  their functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only  in view. Loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the United Nations, as set  forth in its Charter, is a fundamental obligation of all staff members by virtue of their  status as international civil servants;    (f)  While staff members' personal views and convictions, including their  political and religious convictions, remain inviolable, staff members shall ensure that  those views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests  of the United Nations.

(d)  If a staff member whose service has not been satisfactory is demoted to a  lower level, the staff member's eligibility for salary step increment in the lower level  will be based on satisfactory service at the lower level.        Rule 3.3      Salary policy      (a)  On appointment, or on selection to a different category, staff members  shall normally be placed at the first step of the level of their post, unless otherwise  decided by the Secretary-General.    (b)  On selection for a new position at a higher level within the same category,  staff members who hold a fixed-term or a continuing appointment shall be placed at  the lowest step of the level to which they have been assigned that provides an increase  in net base salary equal to at least the amount that would have resulted from the  granting of two steps at the lower level, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary- General.        Rule 3.4      Pensionable remuneration      (a)  The definition of pensionable remuneration is set out in article 51 of the  Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.

ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  26/116      (c)  When a staff member from the General Service and related categories is  recruited to the Professional category and this results in a reduction of the pensionable  remuneration, the level of pensionable remuneration reached prior to the change in  category shall be maintained until it is surpassed by that applicable to the staff  member's grade and step in the Professional category. Contributions payable in  accordance with article 25 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff  Pension Fund shall be based on either:    (i)  The pensionable remuneration of the staff member used to determine such  contributions at the time of change in category; or    (ii) The pensionable remuneration applicable to the staff member's grade and  step in the Professional category;  whichever is higher.        Rule 3.5      Dependency allowances        Definitions      (a)  For the purposes of the Staff Regulations and Rules:    (i)  A ""dependent spouse"" is a spouse whose earnings, if any, do not exceed  the lowest entry level of the United Nations General Service gross salary scales  in force on 1 January of the year concerned for the duty station in the country  of the spouse's place of work.

A staff member's natural or legally adopted child; or      b.  A staff member's stepchild who is residing with the staff member; or      c.  A child who cannot be legally adopted, for whom the staff member  has legal responsibility and who is residing with the staff member;    (iii) A ""dependent child"" is a child for whom the staff member provides main  and continuing support and who meets one of the following criteria:      a.  The child is under the age of 18 years;      b.  The child is between the ages of 18 and 21 years and attends  university or its equivalent full-time; the requirement of residing with the staff  member does not apply in this case;      c.  The child is of any age and has a disability as medically determined  by the Secretary-General as being permanent or for a period that is expected to  be long-term that prevents substantial gainful employment;    (iv) Staff members claiming a child as a dependant must certify that they  provide main and continuous support. This certification must be supported by  documentary evidence under conditions established by the Secretary-General,  if a child:      a.   Does not reside with the staff member;      b.   Is married; or      c.   Is recognized as a dependant under subparagraph (a) (iii) c. above;    ST/SGB/2023/1    27/116  22-28707      (v)  A parent or a sibling of a staff member shall be considered as a secondary  dependant if the staff member provides such a person with not less than half of  that person's financial resources, and in any case with not less than twice the  amount of the dependency allowance. The conditions regarding age, school  attendance and disability are the same for a sibling as those applicable to a staff  member's child in subparagraph (iii) above.        Amount of dependency allowances      (b)  The dependency allowances, which are applicable to the different  categories of staff, shall be payable in accordance with the applicable rates published  by the Secretary-General:     (i)  Dependent spouse allowance: a dependent spouse allowance in the amount  of 6 per cent of net base salary plus post adjustment shall be paid to a staff  member in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service  category with a recognized dependent spouse, under conditions established by  the Secretary-General;     (ii) Single parent allowance: a staff member in the Professional and higher  categories and in the Field Service category recognized as a single parent shall  receive a single parent allowance in the amount of 6 per cent of net base salary  plus post adjustment in respect of the first dependent child, under conditions  established by the Secretary-General.

Subject to the provisions of  staff regulations 3.5 and 3.6 (a), the full amount of the dependency allowance  provided under those regulations and under the Staff Rules in respect of a  dependent child shall be payable, except where the staff members or their spouse  receives a direct governmental grant in respect of the same child. Where such a  governmental grant is made, the dependent child allowance or single parent  allowance payable under this rule shall be the approximate amount by which the  governmental grant is less than the dependent child allowance or single parent  allowance set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules. No dependency  allowance is payable if the governmental grant is equal to or exceeds the rate  set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules;    (iv) Secondary dependent allowance: a secondary dependency allowance shall  be paid in respect of not more than one secondary dependent and such payment  shall not be made when a payment is being made for a dependent spouse.

(b)  While the salaries of staff members in the Professional and higher  categories and in the Field Service category are normally subject to the post  adjustment of their duty station during assignments for one year or more, alternative  arrangements may be made by the Secretary-General under the following  circumstances:    (i)  When staff members are assigned to a duty station whose post adjustment  classification is lower than that of their previous duty station, they may continue  to receive for up to six months the post adjustment applicable to the previous  duty station while at least one member of their immediate family (spouse and  children) remains at that duty station;    (ii) When staff members are assigned for three months or less to a United  Nations field mission or for less than six months elsewhere, the Secretary- General shall decide whether to apply the post adjustment applicable to the duty  station and to pay entitlements applicable when there is a change of official duty  station or, in lieu of the above, to authorize appropriate payments of the daily  subsistence allowance.        Rule 3.7      Rental subsidy      (a)  Internationally recruited staff members who incur higher-than-average  rent costs for reasonable standard accommodations will be paid a supplement to the  post adjustment in the form of a rental subsidy under conditions established by the  Secretary-General.

Duration      (d)  The duration as regulated under staff regulation 3.2 on the education grant  may be extended if the child's education is interrupted for at least one school year by  mandatory national service, illness or other compelling reasons.

If travel to the duty station by the  child is not possible, one outward and return journey by the staff member or spouse  may be authorized in lieu of travel by the child, under conditions established by the  Secretary-General.        Special education grant for a child with a disability      (h)  A special education grant for a child with a disability shall be available to  staff members in all categories, whether serving in their home country or not,  provided that they hold a fixed-term or a continuing appointment.

Rule 3.10      Special post allowance      (a)  Staff members shall be expected to assume temporarily, as a normal part  of their customary work and without extra compensation, the duties and  responsibilities of higher-level posts.    (b)  Without prejudice to the principle that selection to a higher-level position  under staff rule 4.15 (Senior review bodies and central review bodies) shall be the  normal means of recognizing increased responsibilities and demonstrated ability, staff  members holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment who assume the full duties  and responsibilities of a post at a clearly recognizable higher level than their own for  a temporary period exceeding three months may, in exceptional cases, be granted a  non-pensionable special post allowance from the beginning of the fourth month of  service at the higher level.    (c)  In the case of a staff member holding a fixed-term or continuing  appointment who is assigned to serve in a mission, or when a staff member in the  General Service category is required to serve in a higher-level post in the Professional  category, or when a staff member in any category holding a fixed-term or continuing  appointment is required to serve in a post which is classified more than one level  above the staff member's level, the allowance may be paid immediately when the staff  member assumes the higher duties and responsibilities.    ST/SGB/2023/1    31/116  22-28707      (d)  The amount of the special post allowance shall be equivalent to the salary  increase (including post adjustment and dependency allowances, if any) which the  staff member would have received had the staff member been promoted to the next  higher level.        Rule 3.11      Mobility incentive      (a)  The purpose of the mobility incentive is to encourage movement of staff  members to duty stations classified as A to E in accordance with the classification of  duty stations established by the International Civil Service Commission.    (b)  Staff members in the Professional and higher categories, in the Field  Service category, and internationally recruited staff in the General Service category  pursuant to staff rule 4.5 (c) may be paid a non-pensionable mobility incentive  provided that they:    (i)  Hold a fixed-term or continuing appointment; and    (ii) Are on an assignment of one year or more to a new duty station classified  as A to E by the International Civil Service Commission; and    (iii) Have served for five consecutive years or more on a fixed-term or  continuing appointment in the United Nations common system of salaries and  allowances.    (c)  The mobility incentive shall be discontinued upon five continuous years  at the same duty station. In the exceptional case of staff members who remained at  the same duty station for more than five years at the explicit request of the  Organization or for compelling humanitarian reasons, the mobility incentive shall be  payable for one additional year, but in no case for more than a total of six years.    (d)  The amount of the mobility incentive, if any, and the conditions under  which it will be paid, shall be determined after taking into account the number of duty  stations at which staff members have previously served for a period of one year or  longer and the hardship classification of the new duty station to which staff members  are assigned.        Rule 3.12      Hardship allowance      (a)  The purpose of the hardship allowance is to compensate for the hardship  experienced by staff members serving in duty stations classified as B to E by the  International Civil Service Commission.     (b)  Staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service  category, and staff in the General Service category considered internationally  recruited pursuant to staff rule 4.5 (c) who are appointed or reassigned to a new duty  station may be paid a non-pensionable hardship allowance.    (c)  The amount of this allowance, if any, and the conditions under which it  will be paid shall be determined by the Secretary-General taking into account the  degree of difficulty of life and work at each duty station in accordance with the  classification of duty stations established by the International Civil Service  Commission.

(c)  The amount and conditions under which the allowance will be paid shall  be determined by the Secretary-General. When a duty station has been designated as  non-family, the presence of eligible family members of the staff member shall not be  authorized at the duty station, unless exceptionally approved by the Secretary- General. In no event shall the allowance be payable if the Secretary-General has  exceptionally approved the presence of eligible family members of the staff member  at the duty station.        Rule 3.14      Salary advances      (a)  Salary advances may be made to staff members under the following  circumstances and conditions:    (i)  In cases where new staff members arrive without sufficient funds, in such  amount as the Secretary-General may deem appropriate;    (ii) In exceptional and compelling circumstances, and if the request of the staff  member is supported by a detailed justification in writing.

This consideration shall also apply, on a  reciprocal basis, to the specialized agencies brought into relationship with the United  Nations. The Secretary-General may limit eligibility to apply for vacant posts to  internal candidates, as defined by the Secretary-General. If so, other candidates shall  be allowed to apply, under conditions to be defined by the Secretary-General, when  no internal candidate meets the requirements of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the  Charter as well as the requirements of the post.

Rule 4.4      Staff in posts subject to local recruitment      (a)  All staff in the General Service and related categories, except as stipulated  in staff rule 4.5 (c), shall be recruited in the country or within commuting distance of  each office, irrespective of their nationality and of the length of time they may have  been in the country.

(b)  National Professional Officers should be of the nationality of the country  where the office concerned is located. National Professional Officers may be  temporarily assigned outside of the country of their employment to a United Nations  field mission for a period not exceeding three months or to any other duty station for  a period not exceeding six months under conditions established by the Secretary- General.    (c)  A staff member subject to local recruitment under this rule shall not be  eligible to receive payment of the allowances or benefits available to internationally  recruited staff members under staff rule 4.5 (a).        Rule 4.5      Staff in posts subject to international recruitment      (a)  Staff members other than those regarded under staff rule 4.4 as having  been locally recruited shall be considered as having been internationally recruited.  Depending on their type of appointment, the allowances and benefits available to  internationally recruited staff members, may include: payment of travel expenses  upon initial appointment and on separation for themselves and their spouses and  ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  36/116    dependent children; relocation shipment; home leave; education grant; and  repatriation grant.    (b)  Staff recruited locally at a duty station for posts in the Professional and  higher categories at that specific duty station are considered internationally recruited  but would generally not be entitled to some or all of the allowances and benefits  mentioned in paragraph (a) above as determined by the Secretary-General.    (c)  Under special circumstances and conditions determined by the Secretary- General, staff who have been recruited to serve in posts in the General Service and  related categories may be considered internationally recruited.    (d)  Staff members who have changed their residential status in such a way that  they may, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, be deemed to be a permanent  resident of any country other than that of their nationality may lose entitlement to  home leave, education grant, repatriation grant and payment of travel expenses upon  separation from service for the staff members and their spouse and dependent children  and relocation shipment, based upon place of home leave, if the Secretary-General  considers that the continuation of such entitlement would be contrary to the purposes  for which the allowance or benefit was created. Conditions governing entitlement to  benefits for internationally recruited staff in the light of residential status shall be set  by the Secretary-General as applicable to each duty station.        Rule 4.6      Geographical distribution      Recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible, in accordance with the  requirements of staff regulation 4.2, shall not apply to posts in the General Service  and related categories.

(c)  Staff members who are the spouse, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle,  nephew, niece or cousin of another staff member:    (i)  Shall not be assigned to serve in a post which is superior or subordinate in  the line of authority to that staff member;    (ii) Shall not participate in the process of reaching or reviewing an  administrative decision affecting the status or entitlements of that staff member.    (d)  The marriage of one staff member to another shall not affect the  contractual status of either spouse, but their entitlements and other benefits shall be  modified as provided in the relevant Staff Regulations and Rules.

Rule 10.3      Due process in a disciplinary process      (a)  The Secretary-General may initiate a disciplinary process where the  findings of an investigation indicate that misconduct may have occurred. No  disciplinary measure may be imposed on a staff member following the completion of  an investigation unless the staff member has been notified, in writing, of the formal  allegations of misconduct against the staff member and has been given the opportunity  to respond to those formal allegations. The staff member shall also be informed of the  right to seek the assistance of counsel in the staff member's defence through the  Office of Staff Legal Assistance, or from outside counsel at the staff member's own  expense.    (b)  Any disciplinary measure imposed on a staff member shall be  proportionate to the nature and gravity of the staff member's misconduct.     (c)  A staff member against whom disciplinary or non-disciplinary measures,  pursuant to staff rule 10.2, have been imposed following the completion of a  disciplinary process may submit an application challenging the imposition of such  measures directly to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, in accordance with chapter XI  (Appeals) of the Staff Rules.     (d)  An appeal against a judgment of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal by  the staff member or by the Secretary-General may be filed with the United Nations  Appeals Tribunal in accordance with chapter XI (Appeals) of the Staff Rules.

(b)  A staff member placed on administrative leave pursuant to paragraph (a)  above shall be given a written statement of the reason(s) for such leave and its  probable duration.    (c)  Administrative leave shall be with full pay except (i) in cases where there  are reasonable grounds to believe that a staff member engaged in sexual exploitation  and/or sexual abuse, in which case the placement of the staff member on  administrative leave shall be without pay, or (ii) when the Secretary-General decides  that exceptional circumstances exist which warrant the placement of a staff member  on administrative leave with partial pay or without pay.     (d)  Placement on administrative leave shall be without prejudice to the rights  of the staff member and shall not constitute a disciplinary measure. If administrative  leave is with partial pay or without pay and the staff member's conduct at issue does  not lead to the imposition of the disciplinary measure of dismissal or separation from  service, any pay withheld shall be restored without delay.    (e)  A staff member who has been placed on administrative leave may  challenge the decision to place him or her on such leave in accordance with chapter XI  (Appeals) of the Staff Rules.        ST/SGB/2023/1    79/116  22-28707       Article XI     Appeals          Regulation 11.1      There shall be a two-tier formal system of administration of justice:    (a)  The United Nations Dispute Tribunal shall, under conditions prescribed in  its statute and rules, hear and render judgment on an application from a staff member  alleging non-compliance with his or her terms of appointment or the contract of  employment, including all pertinent regulations and rules;    (b)  The United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall, under conditions prescribed in  its statute and rules, exercise appellate jurisdiction over an appeal of a judgment  rendered by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal submitted by either party.      ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  80/116       Chapter XI     Appeals          Rule 11.1      Informal resolution      (a)  Staff members who considers that their contract of employment or terms  of appointment have been violated are encouraged to attempt to have the matter  resolved informally. To that end, a staff member who wishes to pursue informal  channels should approach the Office of the Ombudsman without delay, without  prejudice to the right to pursue the matter formally in accordance with the provisions  of the present chapter.     (b)  Both the staff member and the Secretary-General may initiate informal  resolution, including mediation, of the issues involved at any time before or after the  staff member chooses to pursue the matter formally.    (c)  The conduct of informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman,  including mediation, may result in the extension of the deadlines applicable to  management evaluation and to the filing of an application with the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal, as specified in staff rules 11.2 (c) and (d) and 11.4 (c) below.     (d)  An application shall not be receivable by the United Nations Dispute  Tribunal if the dispute arising from a contested decision has been resolved by an  agreement reached through mediation. However, a staff member may submit an  application directly with the Dispute Tribunal to enforce the implementation of an  agreement reached through mediation within 90 calendar days of the deadline for  implementation as specified in the mediation agreement or, when the mediation  agreement is silent on the matter, within 90 calendar days of the thirtieth calendar day  from the date on which the agreement was signed.        Rule 11.2      Management evaluation      (a)  Staff members wishing to formally contest an administrative decision  alleging non-compliance with their contract of employment or terms of appointment,  including all pertinent regulations and rules pursuant to staff regulation 11.1 (a), shall,  as a first step, submit to the Secretary-General in writing a request for a management  evaluation of the administrative decision.    (b)  A staff member wishing to formally contest an administrative decision  taken pursuant to advice obtained from a duly designated technical body, as  determined by the Secretary-General, or of a decision taken at Headquarters in New  York to impose a disciplinary or non-disciplinary measure pursuant to staff rule 10.2  (Disciplinary measures) following the completion of a disciplinary process is not  required to request a management evaluation.    (c)  A request for a management evaluation shall not be receivable by the  Secretary-General unless it is sent within 60 calendar days from the date on which  the staff member received notification of the administrative decision to be contested.  This deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for informal  resolution conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by  the Secretary-General.    (d)  The Secretary-General's response, reflecting the outcome of the  management evaluation, shall be communicated in writing to the staff member within  30 calendar days of receipt of the request for management evaluation if the staff  member is stationed in New York, and within 45 calendar days of receipt of the    ST/SGB/2023/1    81/116  22-28707    request for management evaluation if the staff member is stationed outside of New  York. The deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for  informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by  the Secretary-General.        Rule 11.3      Suspension of action      (a)  Neither the submission of a request for a management evaluation nor the  filing of an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal shall have the effect  of suspending the implementation of the contested administrative decision.     (b)  However, where a management evaluation of an administrative decision is  required:    (i)  A staff member may submit an application requesting the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal to suspend the implementation of the contested administrative  decision until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff  member has received notification of the outcome. In accordance with article 2,  paragraph 2, of its statute, the Dispute Tribunal may suspend the implementation  of a decision where the decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of  particular urgency and where its implementation would cause irreparable  damage. The Dispute Tribunal's decision on such an application is not subject  to appeal;    (ii) In cases involving separation from service, a staff member may opt to first  request the Secretary-General to suspend the implementation of the decision  until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff member has  received notification of the outcome. The Secretary-General, after determining  that the decision has not yet been implemented, may suspend its implementation  where it appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular urgency and  where its implementation would cause irreparable damage to the staff member's  rights. If the Secretary-General rejects the request, the staff member may then  submit a request for suspension of action to the Dispute Tribunal under  subparagraph (b) (i) above.        Rule 11.4      United Nations Dispute Tribunal      (a)  A staff member may file an application against a contested administrative  decision, whether or not it has been amended by any management evaluation, with  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which  the staff member received the outcome of the management evaluation or from the date  of expiration of the deadline specified under staff rule 11.2 (d), whichever is earlier.    (b)  When staff members are not required to request a management evaluation,  pursuant to staff rule 11.2 (b), he or she may file an application directly with the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which they  received notification of the contested administrative decision.    (c)  Where mediation has been pursued by either party within the deadline for  filing an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal specified in staff  rule 11.4 (a) or (b) and the mediation is deemed to have failed in accordance with the  rules of procedure of the Mediation Division of the Office of the Ombudsman, the  staff member may file an application with the Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar  days of the end of the mediation.  ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  82/116      (d)  Staff members shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of  Staff Legal Assistance if they so wish, or may retain outside counsel at their own  expense, in the presentation of their case before the United Nations Dispute Tribunal.    (e)  A staff association may request permission from the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in relation to an application  filed by a staff member.    (f)  A staff member who is entitled to appeal the same administrative decision  that is the subject of an application brought by another staff member may request  permission from the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to intervene in the matter.    (g)  In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal has jurisdiction over an application filed by a staff member:    (i)  To appeal an administrative decision that is alleged to not be in compliance  with a staff member's contract of employment or terms of appointment,  including all pertinent regulations and rules and all relevant administrative  issuances in force at the time of the alleged non-compliance;    (ii) To appeal an administrative decision imposing a disciplinary measure;    (iii) To enforce the implementation of an agreement reached through  mediation.     (h)  The competence of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, as set forth in its  statute, includes the authority:    (i)  To suspend proceedings in a case at the request of the parties for a time to  be specified by it in writing;    (ii) To order, at any time during the proceedings, an interim measure, which is  not subject to appeal, to provide temporary relief to either party where the  contested decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular  urgency, and where its implementation would cause irreparable damage. Such  temporary relief may include suspension of the implementation of the contested  administrative decision, except in cases of appointment, promotion or  termination;    (iii) To refer, at any time during its deliberations, a matter to mediation with  the consent of both parties.        Rule 11.5      United Nations Appeals Tribunal      (a)  In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations  Appeals Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over an appeal against a judgment of the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal alleging that the Dispute Tribunal has:     (i)  Exceeded its jurisdiction or competence;     (ii) Failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in it;     (iii) Erred on a question of law;     (iv) Committed an error in procedure, such as to affect the decision of the case;  or     (v)  Erred on a question of fact, resulting in a manifestly unreasonable  decision.     (b)  An appeal may be filed by either party against the judgment of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal within 60 calendar days following receipt of the Dispute    ST/SGB/2023/1    83/116  22-28707    Tribunal's judgment. An appeal shall not be receivable by the United Nations Appeals  Tribunal unless the deadline has been met or has been waived or suspended by the  Appeals Tribunal.    (c)  The filing of an appeal with the United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall  have the effect of suspending the execution of a judgment of the United Nations  Dispute Tribunal that is contested.     (d)  Staff members shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of  Staff Legal Assistance if they so wish or may retain outside counsel at their own  expense in the presentation of their case before the United Nations Appeals Tribunal.    (e)  The competence of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, as set forth in its  statute, includes the authority:    (i)  To decide, at its own initiative or at the request of either party, that  exceptional circumstances require the proceedings to be closed;    (ii) To order an interim measure to provide temporary relief to either party to  prevent irreparable harm and to maintain consistency with the judgment of the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal.

In  exceptional cases and at the discretion of the Secretary-General, the lump-sum  boarding assistance may be granted to a staff member at a headquarters duty station  in respect of a child boarding to attend school at the primary and secondary levels  outside the duty station.  (c)  The lump-sum amount for boarding assistance shall also be payable to a staff  member serving at a duty station classified as ""A"" to ""E"" by the International Civil  Service Commission whose child is boarding to attend school at the primary or  secondary level when the educational institution is located beyond commuting  distance from the area where the staff member is serving and, in the opinion of the  Secretary-General, no school in that area would be suitable for the child.         Special education grant    (d)  Under conditions established by the Secretary-General, admissible expenses for  a child with a disability shall include those educational expenses required to provide  an educational programme designed to meet the needs of the child so that the child  may attain the highest level of functional ability. The amount of the grant for each  child with a disability shall be 100 per cent of the admissible expenses actually  incurred, subject to a maximum reimbursement equal to the upper limit of the top  bracket of the sliding scale in paragraph (i) above.   (e)  When boarding is provided, the actual expenses shall be included in the calculation  of the admissible expenses, subject to a maximum reimbursement equal to the upper  limit of the top bracket of the sliding scale in paragraph (i) above plus the amount of  5,300 United States dollars, equivalent to the lump sum for boarding assistance.      ST/SGB/2023/1    101/116  22-28707    Appendix C       Arrangements relating to military service         (a)  In accordance with section 18 (c) of the Convention on Privileges and  Immunities of the United Nations, staff members who are nationals of those Member  States which have acceded to that Convention shall be ""immune from national service  obligations"" in the armed services of the country of their nationality.     (b)  Any requests to Governments which have not acceded to the Convention  to defer or exempt staff members from military service by reason of their employment  with the United Nations shall be made by the Secretary-General and not by the staff  member concerned.     (c)  Staff members who have successfully passed a competitive examination  and have completed one year of satisfactory service under a fixed-term appointment  or who have a continuing appointment may, if called by a Member Government for  military service, whether for training or active duty, be placed on special leave  without pay for the duration of their required military service. Other staff members,  if called for military service, shall be separated from the Secretariat according to the  terms of their appointments.     (d)  A staff member called for military service who is placed on special leave  without pay shall have the terms of appointment maintained as they were on the last  day of service before the staff member went on leave without pay. The staff member's  re-employment in the Secretariat shall be guaranteed, subject only to the normal rules  governing necessary reductions in force or abolition of posts.     (e)  In the interpretation of staff rule 9.6 (e) the period of special leave without  pay for military service shall be counted for the purpose of establishing seniority.     (f)  A staff member on special leave without pay for military service shall be  required to advise the Secretary-General within 90 days after release from military  service if the staff member wishes to be restored to active duty with the Secretariat.  The staff member shall also be required to submit a certificate of completion of  military service.     (g)  If a staff member, after the period of required military service, elects to  continue such service or if the staff member fails to obtain a certified release  therefrom, the Secretary-General will determine, on the merits of the particular case,  whether further special leave without pay will be granted and whether re employment  rights shall be maintained.     (h)  If the staff member's absence on special leave without pay appears likely  to last six months or more, the United Nations will pay, if so requested, for  transporting the staff member's spouse and dependent children to the staff member's  place of entitlement and for their return travel after the staff member's return to active  duty with the Secretariat, provided that the expenses involved will be counted as  travel expenses related to the next home leave entitlement of the staff member.     (i)  The United Nations shall not continue its contribution to the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund on behalf of the staff member during the staff  member's absence on special leave without pay for military service.     (j)  The provisions of staff rule 6.4 relating to death, injury or illness  attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations shall  not be applicable during periods of military service.   ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  102/116      (k)  The Secretary-General may, if the circumstances of the military service  appear to warrant it, credit the staff member's period on special leave without pay for  military service in fixing the salary step upon the staff member's return to active duty  with the Secretariat.     (l)  The Secretary-General may apply such of the foregoing provisions as are  appropriate in the case of a staff member who, with the advance approval of the  Secretary-General, volunteers for military service or requests a waiver of immunity  under section 18 (c) of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United  Nations.         ST/SGB/2023/1    103/116  22-28707    Appendix D        Rules governing compensation in the event of death, injury  or illness attributable to the performance of official duties  on behalf of the United Nations          Section I      Scope and general provisions           Article 1.1       Purpose and scope       The present rules provide for compensation for death, injury or illness  attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations, as  set out below. Compensation shall be provided solely to staff members and their  dependants, in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the present  rules.         Article 1.2       Exclusiveness of remedy; non-assignment       Compensation or other forms of recourse provided under the present rules  constitute the sole remedy for service-incurred death, injury or illness. The United  Nations will not accept, consider or provide compensation or benefits for service- incurred death, injury or illness except under the present rules. Except as set forth  below, compensation and rights shall not be assignable to third parties.         Article 1.3       Terminology       The following terminology applies for the purposes of the present rules:     (a)  Claimant: the staff member or dependant, as defined below, bringing a  claim under these rules.     (b)  Dependant: the spouse, dependent child or secondary dependant as set  forth in the Staff Rules. Compensation payable on the basis of or benefit payable to a  dependent child or secondary dependent sibling ceases on the day the dependent child  or secondary dependent sibling reaches the age of 18, or 21 if the dependent child or  secondary dependent sibling is attending university or its equivalent full-time. This  restriction does not apply where and as long as the dependent child or secondary  dependent sibling has a disability that is permanent or for a period that is expected to  be long-term that prevents gainful employment.     (c)  Minor: an individual under the age of 18, or the age of majority under the  laws of the country of residence of such individual, if the age of majority in the  individual's country of residency is less than 18 years of age.     (d)  Illness: a deterioration in health as confirmed by a physician authorized to  practise medicine by a competent authority.     (e)  Injury: a physiological impairment as confirmed by a physician authorized  to practise medicine by a competent authority.     (f)  Incident: an event causing the death, injury or illness underlying a claim.     (g)  Commute or commuting: travel by reasonable means of transportation and  on a direct route, by time or distance, between place of work and residence. A direct  route is deemed to commence upon departure from, or be terminated on arrival at,  ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  104/116    United Nations premises or the property line at the designated place of work or the  property line of the staff member's place of residence, such residence including yards,  lawns, driveways, garages, stairways, entrances, elevators, basements, hallways or  common areas, without deliberate deviation from such route.     (h)  Reasonable means of transportation: a generally accepted means of  transportation under the circumstances. Transportation by a particularly hazardous  means is not considered a reasonable means of transportation for the purposes of the  present rules.     (i)  Service-incurred death, injury or illness: a death, injury or illness where  the death, injury or illness is directly attributable to the performance of official duties  on behalf of the United Nations under the terms and conditions set out in the present  rules.     (j)  Pensionable remuneration: the definition of pensionable remuneration is  set out in article 51 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.  If the staff member was not a participant in the Fund at the date of the staff member's  death, injury or illness, remuneration shall be that which, had the staff member been  a participant, would have been considered the staff member's pensionable  remuneration at that date.     (k)  Last pensionable remuneration: the pensionable remuneration at the time  of (i) the incident, in the case of permanent disfigurement or permanent loss of  function; (ii) the separation from service, in the case of total disability; or (iii) the  date of death, in the case of death. If the staff member was not a participant in the  United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund at the date of the staff member's death, injury  or illness, the remuneration shall be that which, had the staff member been a  participant, would have been considered the staff member's pensionable remuneration  at that date.     (l)  United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund benefits: the definition of Fund  benefits is set out in article 3.7 below, on the relation to benefits under the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.     (m) Lump sum: a one-time payment of compensation.     (n)  Pre-existing medical condition: an illness, injury or impairment that exists  prior to the incident resulting in the service-incurred death, injury or illness.     (o)  Total disability: incapacity for further work reasonably compatible with  the claimant's abilities, in which such incapacity is due to a service-incurred injury  or illness that is likely to be long-term or permanent. The resulting incapacity must  have a significant adverse impact on the claimant's actual earnings, as determined by  the Secretary-General under the Staff Rules. A determination of total disability under  the Staff Rules shall be independent of a finding of disability under the Regulations  of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.         Article 1.4       Advisory Board on Compensation Claims       (a)  The Secretary-General has established the Advisory Board on  Compensation Claims to consider claims for compensation arising from a service- incurred death, injury or illness and to make recommendations thereon to the  Secretary-General.     (b)  The Board may adopt procedures as it considers necessary for discharging  its functions under the present article, provided that, in cases of conflict, the present  rules prevail.     ST/SGB/2023/1    105/116  22-28707      (c)  Composition of the Board:     (i)  Voting members:       a.  Three representatives of the Administration appointed by the  Secretary-General;       b.  Three representatives of the staff appointed by the Secretary-General  on the recommendation of the staff representative bodies;     (ii) Ex officio members:       a.  Representatives from the Office of Legal Affairs and the Medical  Services Division of the Secretariat may be appointed by the Secretary-General  to serve as ex officio representatives. Representatives from the United Nations  Joint Staff Pension Fund may be appointed by the Chief Executive of Pension  Administration to serve as ex officio representatives;       b.  Such ex officio representatives shall serve in an advisory capacity to  the Board to provide guidance to the Board with respect to the interpretation of  the rules and issues relevant to their offices.         Article 1.5       Secretary of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims       (a)  The Secretary of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims shall be  designated by the Secretary-General or other authorized official. The Secretary may  not, at the same time, be a member of the Board.     (b)  The Secretary of the Board is responsible for preparing claims submitted  under the present rules for consideration by the Board or the official with delegated  authority to consider de minimis claims, as set forth in article 1.6 below. In  discharging the functions and responsibilities under these rules, the Secretary will  seek to obtain sufficient and relevant documentary evidence from appropriate sources.         Article 1.6       De minimis claims       If it is determined that: (a) the potential cumulative cost to the United Nations  of a claim is less than an amount determined by the Secretary-General or officials  with delegated authority; and (b) the claim is solely for reimbursement of medical  expenses, funeral expenses, compensation for permanent disfigurement or loss of  function, or granting of sick leave credit, the official with delegated authority to  consider such de minimis claims may make determinations on the compensability of  a claim, without the consideration of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims.  If the official with delegated authority to consider de minimis claims makes a  determination on a claim, and the claim later exceeds the amount for de minimis  claims, the claim shall be presented to the Board for new consideration.         Article 1.7       Role of the Medical Services Division       (a)  The Medical Services Division shall make a medical determination for  consideration by the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims or the official with  delegated authority to consider de minimis claims. Such a determination may include:     (i)  Whether a death, injury or illness is directly causatively related to an  incident;     (ii) Whether a death, injury or illness is directly causatively related to the  performance of official duties;   ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  106/116      (iii) Whether treatment or services are directly related to a service-incurred  injury or illness;     (iv) Whether treatment or services are reasonably necessary for the treatment  of such an injury or illness;     (v)  Whether medical expenses are at a reasonable cost for the treatment or  services provided;     (vi) Whether absence from work is directly related to a service-incurred injury  or illness;     (vii) Whether a claimant has reached maximum medical improvement, in order  to assess a permanent loss of function;     (viii) Permanent disfigurement or loss of function;     (ix) Total disability.     (b)  In accordance with staff rule 6.2 (h), a staff member may be required to  undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner designated by the United  Nations Medical Director, with the cost to be borne by the Organization, in order to  clarify findings or to further assess the claim in connection with any of the  determinations made pursuant to the present article. A staff member may also be  required to provide further information in connection with any of the determinations  made pursuant to the present article.         Article 1.8       General obligations of claimant       (a)  The claimant must provide the evidence necessary to fully support a claim  for compensation in accordance with these rules.

Article 1.9       Fraud, misrepresentation and omission of material fact       (a)  If a claimant makes a submission or a claim that is fraudulent, contains a  material misrepresentation or omits a material fact, all claims related to the incident  by that claimant shall be denied, all compensation or benefits payable to the claimant  in relation to the claim shall be terminated and all payments made in relation to the  claim shall be subject to recovery.     (b)  When made by staff members, such claims may constitute misconduct  under chapter X of the Staff Rules, and may result in disciplinary measures.

(b)  The Advisory Board on Compensation Claims will assess whether the  death, injury or illness is service-incurred and provide its recommendation on a claim  to the Secretary-General. For de minimis claims, the official with delegated authority  to consider de minimis claims will assess whether the death, injury or illness is  service-incurred and take a decision on the claim on behalf of the Secretary-General.     (c)  Such an assessment will be based on the claimant's submissions, and, as  appropriate, the recommendations of the Medical Services Division, technical advice  from ex officio members of the Board and any other relevant documentary or other  evidence.         Service-incurred death, injury or illness       (d)  A death, injury or illness is service-incurred if it is directly attributable to  the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations, in that it occurred  while engaged in activities and at a place required for the performance of official  duties.     (i)  Incidents on the United Nations premises: if an incident occurs on United  Nations premises, the resulting injury, illness or death may be service-incurred,  unless at the time of the incident the staff member is engaged in an activity  outside the scope of the staff member's official duties;     (ii) Incidents off the United Nations premises: if an incident occurs away from  the United Nations premises, the resulting injury, illness or death may be  service-incurred if such death, injury or illness would not have occurred but for  the performance of official duties, and if the incident occurred in any of the  following circumstances:       a.

Aggravation of a pre-existing medical condition       (e)  Claims based, in whole or in part, upon any aggravation of a pre-existing  medical condition shall not be compensated unless such aggravation is service- incurred, and such compensation shall be solely for the proportion of the injury or  illness deemed service-incurred.

Such a grant is limited to the maximum extent of the prior sick leave  used for the separate service-incurred injury or illness. No credit will be granted  for any sick leave already revived under the time frames of staff rule 6.2 (c);    (ii)  To maintain the full pay status of a staff member being considered for a  disability benefit pursuant to article 33 (a) of the Regulations of the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, who has exhausted the sick leave entitlement.

If such travel is commenced  or terminated within 12 months of the staff member's eligibility for home leave  entitlement pursuant to staff rule 5.4 and chapter VII of the Staff Rules, such special  travel allowance shall be deemed to be in lieu of the staff member's home leave  entitlement.

Future claims       (f)  Any amount of compensation that a claimant may be entitled to receive in  the future pursuant to the present rules shall be first used to offset any monies received  by the claimant under subparagraph (e) (iii) above.         Article 4.2       Recovery of overpayments       (a)  If the United Nations has paid a claimant in excess of any compensation  payable under the present rules, the United Nations will notify the claimant of the  amount of overpayment and request reimbursement.     (b)  If immediate reimbursement in full is not feasible, any future periodic  payments of compensation payable to the claimant under the present rules shall be  reduced by 20 per cent until the overpayment has been reimbursed in full. If immediate  reimbursement in full of any lump-sum payment made under the present rules is not  feasible, the Secretary-General will seek recovery by means including, but not limited  to, the reduction of any future lump sum payments of compensation payable to the  claimant under the present rules by the entire amount of the overpayment.          Section V      Reconsideration, review and appeal           Article 5.1       Reconsideration of medical determinations       Claimants wishing to contest a decision taken on a claim under the present rules,  when that decision is based upon a medical determination by the Medical Services  Division or the United Nations Medical Director, shall submit a request for  reconsideration of the medical determination under conditions, and by a technical  body, established by the Secretary-General.     ST/SGB/2023/1      22-28707  116/116        Article 5.2       Review and appeal of administrative decisions       Claimants wishing to contest a decision taken on a claim under the present rules,  to the extent that the decision was based on considerations other than a medical  determination, shall submit to the Secretary-General a written request for  management evaluation in accordance with staff rule 11.2.       Article 5.3       Reopening of claims       Upon a written request by a claimant, or at the initiative of the Secretary- General, a claim made under the present rules may be reopened when one or more of  the following criteria are met:     (a)  The discovery of new material evidence, if such new material evidence  may materially affect:     (i)  A determination as to whether a death, injury or illness was service- incurred; or     (ii)  A relevant medical determination;     (b)  A worsening or improvement in the condition of the staff member, where  such worsening or improvement is directly related to the service-incurred injury or  illness, and which may entitle the staff member to additional compensation, or  warrant the reduction or elimination of compensation;     (c)  A material mistake was made by the United Nations in the processing of a  claim that had an impact on its disposition.     When a claim is reopened subject to the provisions above, any such claim shall  be considered in accordance with the present rules. The Secretary-General and the  claimant shall be bound by determinations previously made, unless new material  evidence or material mistake undermines or otherwise calls into question in  substantial part those determinations.          Section VI      Transitional measures           Article 6.1       Transitional measures       (a)  For claims filed for incidents occurring after the entry into force of the  present revised rules, such revised rules will be applied.     (b)  For claims filed for incidents that occurred prior to the entry into force of  the present revised rules, the previously applicable rules will be applied, except that  annual compensation for widows or widowers under the former article 10.2 will  continue to be payable provided that the widow or widower has not remarried prior  to the entry into force of the present revised rules.    22-28707 (E)    230123  *2228707*  "

Introduction       1.  Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations establishes the  universal standard for all staff members employed by the United Nations as the  ""highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity"". It is thus axiomatic that  these standards apply to all staff whose employment relationship derives from the  authority vested by the Charter in the Organization to employ individuals as staff  members. These basic standards are common to all staff, including those of the  separately funded and administered organs.   2.  The statutory provisions set out in the present annex are an integral part of the  Staff Regulations of the United Nations and Staff Rules, with regulations being  adopted by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter  and with rules being promulgated by the Secretary-General pursuant to the authority  granted to him or her by the scope and purpose provision of the Staff Regulations.  3.  The provisions of article I of the Staff Regulations are in most parts very  general, as they must apply to all staff, including those of the separately funded  organs. Similarly, the provisions of chapter I of the Staff Rules contained in the  present annex are, for the most part, very general, as they must apply to all staff  appointed under the Staff Regulations and Rules.          Role of the commentary      4.  Each provision of the Staff Regulations and Rules set out in the present annex  is followed by a commentary. The commentary is designed to explain individual  provisions and to help staff members understand each provision by placing it into  context. It is not part of the Staff Regulations and Rules and so is not a legal norm,  nor does it have the legal force of a rule. It is, however, an official guide published  by the Secretary-General for the use of management and staff on the scope and  application of the regulations and rules contained in this annex. Staff may thus  safely rely on the commentary to guide their actions, since it provides a more  detailed understanding of and guidance on the statutory provisions and of staff  members' basic rights and obligations.   5.  In view of the need for staff to have a guide to their status, rights and duties  conveniently at hand, the present annex contains extracts from the Charter and the  Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the text of  article I of the Staff Regulations and the text of the related provisions of chapter I of  the Staff Rules, together with the explanatory commentary, as well as the text of the  2013 ""Standards of conduct for the international civil service"" proposed by the  International Civil Service Commission in its report for 2012 (A/67/30 and Corr.1)  and approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/257 (the ""2013 standards  of conduct"") effective 1 January 2013.          Status of the ""Standards of conduct for the international  civil service""       6.  The 2013 standards of conduct are aimed at assisting staff members and  executive heads of the organizations in understanding better the obligations placed    ST/SGB/2016/9        7/48  16-12690    on staff conduct by the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules. They provide a  discussion of expected standards to help staff understand their role as international  civil servants, complementing the Staff Regulations and Rules. References to  relevant paragraphs in the standards of conduct are made in the commentary.        II. Charter of the United Nations and the Convention on the  Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations         Provisions relating to the status, basic rights and duties of  United Nations staff members, with commentary        A. Charter of the United Nations          Chapter III      Organs        Article 7    1.  There are established as the principal organs of the United Nations: a General  Assembly, a Security Council, an Economic and Social Council, a Trusteeship  Council, an International Court of Justice, and a Secretariat.  2.  Such subsidiary organs as may be found necessary may be established in  accordance with the present Charter.        Article 8      The United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and  women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its  principal and subsidiary organs.        Chapter XV      The Secretariat        Article 97      The Secretariat shall comprise a Secretary-General and such staff as the  Organization may require. The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General  Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. He shall be the chief  administrative officer of the Organization.        Article 98      The Secretary-General shall act in that capacity in all meetings of the General  Assembly, of the Security Council, of the Economic and Social Council, and of the  Trusteeship Council, and shall perform such other functions as are entrusted to him  by these organs. The Secretary-General shall make an annual report to the General  Assembly on the work of the Organization.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  8/48        Article 100    1.  In the performance of their duties the Secretary-General and the staff shall not  seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other authority  external to the Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect  on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization.  2.  Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to respect the exclusively  international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff  and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities.        Article 101    1.  The staff shall be appointed by the Secretary-General under regulations  established by the General Assembly.  2.  Appropriate staffs shall be permanently assigned to the Economic and Social  Council, the Trusteeship Council, and, as required, to other organs of the United  Nations. These staffs shall form a part of the Secretariat.  3.  The paramount consideration in the employment of the staff and the  determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing the  highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due regard shall be paid  to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.        Chapter XVI      Miscellaneous provisions        Article 105    1.  The Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such  privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes.  2.  Representatives of the Members of the United Nations and officials of the  Organization shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary  for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization.  3.  The General Assembly may make recommendations with a view to  determining the details of the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article or  may propose conventions to the Members of the United Nations for this purpose.        B. Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the  United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly by its  resolution 22 (I) of 13 February 1946          Article V    Section 20. Privileges and immunities are granted to officials in the interests of the  United Nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves ...  Section 21. The United Nations shall cooperate at all times with the appropriate  authorities of Members to facilitate the proper administration of justice, secure the  observance of police regulations, and prevent the occurrence of any abuse in  connection with the privileges, immunities and facilities ...      ST/SGB/2016/9        9/48  16-12690        Commentary        Staff members    1.  The Charter requires that staff members be ""appointed"" by the Secretary- General (or by those to whom this power has been delegated, either by the  Secretary-General alone or by the Secretary-General at the direction of the General  Assembly). The hallmark of a staff relationship is a letter of ""appointment"" issued  pursuant to staff regulation 4.1. The Staff Regulations apply to all staff members  within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter, whose employment relationship and  contractual link with the Organization are through a letter of appointment issued  pursuant to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly.  2.  To ensure that the revised Regulations apply to all staff members of the  Organization, including all staff members of all its principal and subsidiary organs,  even those with entirely separate administrations, the following sentence has been  inserted between the second and third sentence of the ""Scope and purpose""  provision of the Staff Regulations:    ""For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions 'United Nations  Secretariat', 'staff members' or 'staff' shall refer to all the staff members of  the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United  Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a  letter of appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General  Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter.""  The entire text of this provision is set out in section III of the present annex.  3.  Article 105 of the Charter empowers the General Assembly to make provisions  for the privileges and immunities of the ""officials"" of the Organization. The  Assembly did so by adopting the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the  United Nations on 13 February 1946 (hereinafter the ""General Convention"").  Article V of the General Convention provides for privileges and immunities for  officials and article VII provides for the issue of United Nations laissez-passers to  officials. By its resolution 76 (I) of 7 December 1946, the Assembly approved that  the provisions in articles V and VII of the General Convention apply to all staff  members of the United Nations with the exception of those ""recruited locally and  assigned to hourly rates"". Thus, all staff members governed by the Staff Regulations  are officials of the Organization.        III. Scope and purpose of the Staff Regulations of the  United Nations          Article I of the Staff Regulations of the United Nations and related  rules from chapter I of the Staff Rules, with commentary          Staff Regulations of the United Nations      Scope and purpose      The Staff Regulations embody the fundamental conditions of service and the  basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat. They represent  the broad principles of human resources policy for the staffing and administration of  the Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions ""United  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  10/48    Nations Secretariat"", ""staff members"" or ""staff"" shall refer to all the staff members  of the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United  Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of  appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant  to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief  administrative officer, shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with  these principles as he or she considers necessary.        Article I      Duties, obligations and privileges        Staff regulation 1.1      Status of staff        Regulation 1.1 (a)      Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as staff  members are not national but exclusively international.        Commentary      Staff regulation 1.1 (a) clarifies that the responsibilities of staff are exclusively  international owing to their status as international civil servants (see paras. 3-15,  33 and 34 of the 2013 standards of conduct, reproduced in the present annex). This  requisite international outlook stems from an understanding of and loyalty to the  objectives and purposes of the United Nations itself. The term ""international civil  servants"" and the inherent rights and obligations that attach to this status apply to  all staff, whether locally or internationally recruited.         Regulation 1.1 (b)      Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by the  Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative:      ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government  or other source external to the Organization.      ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations  incumbent upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (b) contains the declaration of office of staff, and its  opening words incorporate the text of former staff regulation 1.9 insofar as it relates  to staff members (see paras. 3-15 of the 2013 standards of conduct). It requests staff  members upon entry on duty to expressly declare that they will act with the interests  of the Organization only in view in the discharge of their functions.  2.  The second paragraph of the declaration refers specifically to the Staff  Regulations and Rules.    ST/SGB/2016/9        11/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.1 (c)      The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff members,  as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the relevant  resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected.        Commentary      The regulation codifies a duty that falls on the Secretary-General, that is, to  ensure that the rights and duties of staff members are respected.        Regulation 1.1 (d)      The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount consideration in  the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing staff  of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (d) places on the Secretary-General an affirmative duty to  seek to ensure that the criteria set out in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter  for the determination of the conditions of service of the staff are implemented. This  provision is not intended to affect the role of legislative bodies involved in the  process of establishing conditions of service. It does, however, seek to formulate the  responsibility of the Secretary-General to advocate, in the appropriate forums, the  adoption of what he or she considers to be the appropriate conditions of service to  secure the recruitment and retention of staff possessing the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity.  2.  The salaries of staff in the Professional and higher categories are determined  by reference to the best paying national civil service under what is known as the  Noblemaire principle. The salaries of staff in the General Service and related  categories are established by the Secretary-General on the basis of the best  prevailing conditions of employment in the locality where the United Nations office  concerned is located under what is commonly referred to as the Flemming principle.  The determination of the conditions of service of staff in the Field Service category  follows the same pattern as the Professional category.        Regulation 1.1 (e)      The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the  separately funded organs, holding appointments under the Staff Rules.        Commentary      Regulation 1.1 (e) makes clear that the Staff Regulations apply to all staff  members, irrespective of levels, including staff members of the separately funded  organs within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter whose contractual link with  the Organization is through a letter of appointment issued pursuant to regulations  promulgated by the General Assembly.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  12/48        Regulation 1.1 (f)      The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of  Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These  privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered  by them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are  located nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private  obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these  privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to  the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and  immunities exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant  instruments.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (f) defines the scope and extent of the privileges and  immunities of the United Nations that are enjoyed by staff in the interest of the  Organization (see also paras. 43 and 44 of the 2013 standards of conduct).  2.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) (see below) deals with the obligation of staff to honour their  private legal obligations.        Staff rule 1.1       Status of staff        Rule 1.1 (a)      The declaration made by a staff member on appointment pursuant to staff  regulation 1.1 (b) shall be placed in his or her official status file. A new declaration  shall be made after a break in service that exceeds three months.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.1 (a) codifies that the written declaration made on appointment is  placed in the official status file. The second sentence seeks to ensure that a new  declaration is made after a break in service that exceeds three months unless the  staff member is reinstated and the staff member's services are considered continuous  under current staff rule 4.18 (b).        Rule 1.1 (b)      The declaration administered under staff regulation 1.1 (b) shall not prevent  the close collaboration of staff with a Government pursuant to an agreement  between the Government and the United Nations.         Commentary      Staff rule 1.1 (b) clarifies that the written declaration does not prevent staff  members from liaising and working with a Government where there has been an  agreement, such as a technical cooperation agreement, between the Government  and the United Nations. Staff members remain bound by their declaration towards  the Organization and the principles guiding the international civil service.       ST/SGB/2016/9        13/48  16-12690        Staff regulation 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff        Core values        Regulation 1.2 (a)      Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the Charter,  including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human  person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff members  shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any  individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested  in them.        Commentary      This provision describes the basic values and behaviours expected of  international civil servants because of their status. At the heart of those values are  the principles set out in the preamble to the Charter. The first sentence is a  quotation from those opening words, and the second sentence sets out the obligation  of staff flowing from a commitment to those values (see also paras. 2-6, 14, 15, 21  and 22 of the 2013 standards of conduct).        Regulation 1.2 (b)      Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to, probity,  impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and  status.        Commentary    1.  This provision describes more basic values expected of international civil  servants because of their status. It is derived from Article 101, paragraph 3, of the  Charter and affirmatively places on staff the obligation to uphold the highest  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity after appointment to the  Secretariat.  2.  At the heart of those values is integrity, allied with a dedication to the values  and principles set out in the Charter. As discussed in paragraph 5 of the  2013 standards of conduct, the concept of integrity ""embraces all aspects of  behaviour of an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty,  truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility"".  3.  Various other provisions deal with particular manifestations of this set of basic  values in different circumstances, for example, staff regulations 1.2 (d)-(i), (m)  and (n).        General rights and obligations        Regulation 1.2 (c)      Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to  assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In  exercising this authority the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  14/48    the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for  staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them.        Commentary    1.  The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer of the Organization,  has an inherent responsibility to seek to ensure the safety of staff. This regulation  recognizes that responsibility as a basic right of staff (see also para. 41 of the 2013  standards of conduct).  2.  In exercising his or her authority to assign staff to any of the activities of the  Organization, the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that, while assigned to  hardship areas, staff are afforded reasonable conditions of life and work having  regard to the existing conditions.  3.  Furthermore, since staff are subject to assignment, measures should be taken  to ensure that staff are advised of conditions prevailing at the duty station to which  they are assigned.        Regulation 1.2 (d)      In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor accept  instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the  Organization.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (d) flows from the first sentence of Article 100,  paragraph 1, of the Charter (see paras. 8, 12, 33 and 34 of the 2013 standards of  conduct).  2.  This regulation makes clear that directions or instructions to staff come from  the Secretary-General, who must fulfil only the legislative mandates of the  Organization. This is true in all areas, including, for example, decisions relating to  the appointment and promotion of staff, which are for the Secretary-General to  make as the chief administrative officer of the Organization. In this context, it is  improper for staff to request or allow a Government to intervene in a selection or  appointment decision.         Regulation 1.2 (e)      By accepting appointment, staff members pledge themselves to discharge their  functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in  view. Loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the United Nations, as set forth  in its Charter, is a fundamental obligation of all staff members by virtue of their  status as international civil servants.        Commentary    1.  The first sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) reiterates the oath or declaration  of office and sets out the principle that staff must regulate their conduct with only  the interests of the Organization in view (see paras. 4 and 7 of the 2013 standards of  conduct). The second sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) focuses on the concept of  loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the Organization as set out in the    ST/SGB/2016/9        15/48  16-12690    Charter (which is alluded to in the declaration contained in staff regulation 1.1 (b))  (ibid., paras. 4, 7 and 34). It highlights those obligations which arise from the very  status of a staff member and which, at present, are set out only in the declaration  subscribed to by staff upon their entry on duty.  2.  The Secretary-General, and those to whom he or she has delegated decision- making authority, has the responsibility to make decisions as to whether the staff  have complied with the provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules. Since no set of  rules, no matter how long or complex, can cover all situations, it is clear that there  must be discretion in the application of the rules. This is common to all systems of  administrative law. However, the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General is  not unlimited, and relevant jurisprudence has consistently held that decisions  cannot be tainted by prejudice, arbitrariness, improper motive or discrimination.         Regulation 1.2 (f)      While staff members' personal views and convictions, including their political  and religious convictions, remain inviolable, staff members shall ensure that those  views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests of  the United Nations. They shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner befitting  their status as international civil servants and shall not engage in any activity that is  incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties with the United Nations. They  shall avoid any action and, in particular, any kind of public pronouncement that may  adversely reflect on their status, or on the integrity, independence and impartiality  that are required by that status.        Commentary    1.  As stated in paragraph 2 of the 2013 standards of conduct:    ""... international civil servants have a special calling: to serve the ideals of  peace, respect for fundamental rights, economic and social progress, and  international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on international civil  servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for, ultimately, it is the  international civil service that will enable the United Nations system to bring  about a just and peaceful world.""  (See also para. 5 on the integrity expected of international civil servants; paras. 4, 7  and 37 on loyalty; paras. 6, 9 and 14 on tolerance and understanding; paras. 9  and 10 on impartiality; paras. 11 and 12 on independence; paras. 4, 14 and 40 on  international outlook; and para.15 on freedom from discrimination.)  2.  The 2013 standards of conduct state, in paragraph 9:      ""Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with  political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate,  international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take  sides or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either  individually or as members of a group, irrespective of the medium used. This  can mean that, in certain situations, personal views should be expressed only  with tact and discretion.""  3.  As noted in the commentary on regulation 1.2 (e), it is for the Secretary- General to decide whether a staff member has met the standards set out in this  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  16/48    provision. While the Secretary-General has the responsibility and discretion to  assess a staff member's conduct, such discretion must be exercised reasonably,  without improper motives and in accordance with the requirements of due process.  The United Nations Dispute and Appeals Tribunals have reiterated this principle in  their jurisprudence.         Regulation 1.2 (g)      Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their  official functions for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for the private gain of  any third party, including family, friends and those they favour. Nor shall staff  members use their office for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those  they do not favour.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (g) is consistent with principles set out in the  2013 standards of conduct (paras. 23-26 29, 38 and 39). The use of one's office for  personal gain is unacceptable. This includes conducting business from a United  Nations office or using the Organization's property, such as information technology  resources. As such, it includes using the United Nations facilities for a business,  using the United Nations name, logo or address for a business or approving a  contract for a family business, as well as conducting business for private gain  through a personal e-mail using the Organization's information technology  infrastructure or equipment. It also reflects the principle that staff members shall  not use information that has not been made public for the private advantage of the  staff member or any third party.  2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (g), for the sake of clarity, makes specific reference to the  prohibition on a staff member favouring a third party, including family or friends,  from profiting from a staff member's position or the exercise of his or her functions.  The terms ""family"" and ""friends"" are broad and intended to encompass not only  family members and friends as normally understood, but also relationships that are  not recognized by the Staff Regulations and Rules as creating a dependency.   3.  The regulation also prohibits the use of office or knowledge gained from that  office for personal reasons to prejudice or harm the careers of individual staff  members or harm third parties.   4.   This regulation also applies to and prohibits using one's office or the  Organization's property or resources, including information technology, to advertise  or otherwise advance private or political interests of others, including, but not  limited to, private companies or political parties. This includes the use of private  e-mail in the office or through the Organization's infrastructure or equipment for  such purposes.         Regulation 1.2 (h)      Staff members may exercise the right to vote but shall ensure that their  participation in any political activity is consistent with, and does not reflect  adversely upon, the independence and impartiality required by their status as  international civil servants.      ST/SGB/2016/9        17/48  16-12690        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (h) reiterates the principle addressed in the 2013  standards of conduct (paras. 9, 10, 33, 48 and 49) emphasizing the need to ensure  that political activities do not have an impact on the independence and impartiality  of staff. This provision clarifies that staff members may have political views in  general, but need to ensure that political views and activities do not have an impact  on their independence and impartiality.   2.  The notion of consistency with the status of an international civil servant is to  be determined by the Secretary-General in view of the necessity of staff being, and  appearing to be, independent and impartial. Thus, it is clear that staff members  cannot be candidates for political office. In case of doubt, inquiries could be made  by staff pursuant to staff rule 1.2 (t) and relevant administrative issuances  governing outside activities, as well as to the Ethics Office.  3.  Staff members have the right to form staff representative bodies in accordance  with staff regulations 8.1 and 8.2 in order to ensure, in the words of staff regulation  8.1, ""the effective participation of staff in identifying, examining and resolving  issues relating to staff welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of  life and other human resources policies"".  4.   Staff regulation 1.2 (h) also addresses participation in political events in  public such as a political rally. While staff may have political views, their status as  impartial international civil servants never ceases while in service, and expression  of a particular political opinion or opinion about a particularly sensitive political  matter in public may not be compatible with that status.         Regulation 1.2 (i)      Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of  official business. They shall not communicate to any Government, entity, person or  any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position  that they know or ought to have known has not been made public, except as  appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary- General. These obligations do not cease upon separation from service.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (i) reflects the fact that official information cannot be used  for private purposes, except with authorization. This flows from the idea that staff  members should place the interests of the Organization above their own (see para. 4  of the 2013 standards of conduct and the wording of the declaration under staff  regulation 1.1) and is intended to protect sensitive and confidential information  where the disclosure would have an adverse impact on the Organization's interests,  operations and activities. It follows that permission must be obtained for disclosure  to third parties of information that has not been made public, unless such disclosure  is in the normal course of the duties of the staff member (for example, a press  officer) or a staff member was specifically authorized to make such disclosure in the  circumstances in question (see also staff regulation 1.2 (r) regarding the duty of  staff to cooperate with United Nations investigations).  2.  The last sentence of the regulation provides that the obligations set out in the  provision do not cease upon separation from service. If a former staff member were  to ignore the regulation, a note could be placed in his or her official status file to  prevent re-employment.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  18/48        Honours, gifts or remuneration      Regulation 1.2 (j)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulations 1.2 (j), (k) and (l) provide the basic provisions regulating the  issue of acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from outside sources (see paras. 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of  conduct).a The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the independence and  impartiality of staff members.   2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) contains the basic rule that staff may not accept any  honour, decoration, gift or remuneration from any Government (ibid., para. 47), b  whereby the term ""Government"" is to be understood broadly, including national,  state and municipal authorities and any government representative or other agent  as well as intergovernmental organizations.   3.   This rule applies whatever the reason for the award, even if the award is  unrelated to the staff member's service with the Organization, since it is imperative  that an international civil servant be perceived as independent from any national  Government or other international organization. This includes governmental  housing supplements or other support payments or perquisites, which in all cases  can be deemed as a possible conflict of interest and infringement into the staff  member's impartial status. It does not apply, however, to subsidies or perquisites  offered locally to all United Nations staff members at a duty station such as state- subsidized childcare facilities or other aspects addressed in the host country  agreement context such as tax or duty exemptions.   4.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) stresses the importance of the appearance of strict  independence and impartiality of staff and thus reaffirms the absolute prohibition  on acceptance of benefits from Governments. No exception to this prohibition  beyond staff regulation 1.2 (k) (see below) is foreseen, and there is no basis for the  Secretary-General to grant approval for acceptance.   5.   This provision does not include receipt of remuneration in the form of salary  from another international organization where staff are serving under an approved  contractual modality such as secondment or loan on the basis of the Inter- Organization Agreement concerning Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among  the Organizations Applying the United Nations Common System of Salaries and  Allowances or bilateral agreements.       __________________    a  Even though para. 50 envisages the possibility of authorization by the executive head of an  organization of an honour, decoration, gift, favour or remuneration from a Government, this is  precluded by staff regulation 1.2 (j), as explained in paras. 2 and 3 of the commentary on  regulation 1.2 (j).    b  Staff regulation 3.4 (c) envisages that staff members may accept child benefits from their  Governments but that, in such a case, United Nations dependency benefits will be reduced. The  United Nations may also consider accepting housing provided from Governments, and when staff  are assigned to such housing, rental deductions from emoluments are applicable.    ST/SGB/2016/9        19/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.2 (k)      If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift from a  Government would cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff member may  receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and entrust it to the  Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the Organization or arrange for its  disposal for the benefit of the Organization or for a charitable purpose.c         Commentary      It can happen that a staff member is given an unanticipated honour,  decoration, favour or gift, perhaps in public, by a minister or even a head of State.  In such cases, a public refusal could cause a needlessly unpleasant incident. In such  cases, regulation 1.2 (k) clarifies that the unanticipated honour, decoration, favour  or gift may be received by the staff member, but only and expressly on behalf of the  United Nations. The honour, decoration, favour or gift must then be given to the  Secretary-General for retention or disposal by the Organization. d Remuneration  from a Government must always be refused, and such refusal, as staff are paid by  the Organization, could hardly cause embarrassment.        Regulation 1.2 (l)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the  approval of the Secretary-General.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (l) requires that a staff member not accept any honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from a non-governmental source without  first obtaining the approval of the Secretary-General (see also paras. 50 and 51 of  the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  A non-governmental source means any non-governmental organization or any  private source. Educational institutions, even though at times publicly or  government-funded, are considered to be a non-governmental source.e   3.   Approval is not granted where the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is incompatible with the status of an international civil servant; or  may be granted with conditions such as the obligation to entrust it to the  Organization upon receipt, in particular when the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is related to the official function of the staff member.   4.   Staff rule 1.2 (l) allows for acceptance of an unanticipated honour, decoration,  favour or gift under similar circumstances of acceptance of gifts from Governments.       __________________    c  See ST/AI/2010/1 on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources.    d  Ibid.    e  Ibid.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  20/48        Conflict of interest        Regulation 1.2 (m)      A conflict of interest occurs when, by act or omission, a staff member's  personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official duties and  responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality required by the  staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an actual or possible  conflict of interest does arise, the conflict shall be disclosed by staff members to  their head of office, mitigated by the Organization and resolved in favour of the  interests of the Organization.        Commentary    1.  The purpose of staff regulation 1.2 (m) is to inform staff that they cannot allow  personal interests to interfere with the performance of their duties or their status as  international civil servants. The regulation clarifies that actual as well as potential  conflicts must be avoided, disclosed and resolved. The key interest is the interest of  the Organization. It will be for the Secretary-General and heads of departments to  assess whether a particular act or omission raises a potential conflict of interest  situation. Staff are obliged to disclose even possible conflicts and to follow  instructions on how to resolve the situation, including to avoid and remove the  conflict or the circumstances that make it a possible conflict. Failure by a staff  member to disclose an actual or possible conflict can seriously disrupt operations of  the Organization and pose detriment to the Organization's integrity and reputation  as a whole, and may lead to the imposition of disciplinary measures against the staff  member.   2.   The definition of ""conflict of interest"" is complemented by the similar but  more comprehensive definition set out in paragraph 23 of the 2013 standards of  conduct, as follows:     ""Conflicts of interest may occur when an international civil servant's personal  interests interfere with the performance of his/her official duties or call into  question the qualities of integrity, independence and impartiality required by  the status of an international civil servant. Conflicts of interest include  circumstances in which international civil servants, directly or indirectly, may  benefit improperly, or allow a third party to benefit improperly, from their  association with their organization. Conflicts of interest can arise from an  international civil servant's personal or familial dealings with third parties,  individuals, beneficiaries, or other institutions. If a conflict of interest or  possible conflict of interest does arise, the conflict shall be disclosed,  addressed and resolved in the best interest of the organization. Questions  entailing a conflict of interest can be very sensitive and need to be treated with  care.""   3.  This provision does not seek to affect the efforts of staff associations  established under staff regulation 8.1 to raise funds from staff for their activities.        Regulation 1.2 (n)      All staff members at the D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial  disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals therefore as prescribed by the  Secretary-General, in respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent    ST/SGB/2016/9        21/48  16-12690    children, and to assist the Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the  information submitted when so requested. The financial disclosure statements shall  include certification that the assets and economic activities of the staff members,  their spouses and their dependent children do not pose a conflict of interest with  their official duties or the interests of the United Nations. The financial disclosure  statements will remain confidential and will only be used, as prescribed by the  Secretary-General, in making determinations pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (m).  The Secretary-General may require other staff to file financial disclosure statements  as he or she deems necessary in the interest of the Organization.         Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (n) includes all staff at the D-1 level and above in the  obligation to submit financial disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals  as prescribed by the Secretary-General (see also para. 24 of the 2013 standards of  conduct), in respect of themselves, their spouses and dependent children. This  requirement is designed to minimize the risk of officials being perceived as using  their position for personal gain and to detect, manage or mitigate reputational and  conflict of interest risks to the Organization. The regulation makes it clear that these  financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will only be used by the  Secretary-General in assessing whether an actual or possible conflict of interest as  per staff regulation 1.2 (m) exists. Staff are in all cases obliged to also inform their  head of office or department in case of any actual or possible conflict of interest  under staff regulation 1.2 (m), regardless of whether or not they are required to file  a financial disclosure statement.   2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (n) places the burden of the initial assessment on the staff  members themselves: staff members have to certify that no conflict of interest exists.  Staff members must fully cooperate with the Secretary-General's efforts to verify  any submitted information. Where in doubt, staff members should contact the Ethics  Office to seek advice about risks for conflicts of interest and how to manage them.  Where there is even a possibility of an actual or potential conflict of interest, staff  are obliged to inform their head of office or department; this is independent and  separate from the disclosure mechanism under staff regulation 1.2 (n).f Further,  filing a financial disclosure statement does not substitute for the obligation to  inform the head of office or department of any actual or potential conflict of  interest.  3.   Staff regulation 1.2 (n) also gives to the Secretary-General the authority to  prescribe the form and periodic interval of such disclosure statements, to establish  procedures to ensure that the statements remain confidential, and to require other  staff to file financial disclosure statements.   4.   The Secretariat's mechanism for financial disclosure statements under staff  regulation 1.2 (n) is detailed in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2006/6,  entitled ""Financial disclosure and declaration of interest statements"".g     __________________    f  The Secretary-General, by his bulletin ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment  and terms of reference"", entrusted the Ethics Office with the task of administering the financial  disclosure programme.    g  Throughout the bulletin, any references to administrative issuances include any amendment or  superseding issuance on the subject.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  22/48        Outside employment and activities        Regulation 1.2 (o)      Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment,  whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (o) reflects the Organization's long-standing policy on  outside occupation or employment, whether during or outside the work week (see  also paras. 45-49 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  The notion of occupation includes, but is not limited to, the practice of a  profession or calling (whether as an employee or on an independent contract) or  any concern in the nature of trade. Employment is generally understood as a legal  relationship pursuant to which one person is providing work and skill at the control  and direction of another. At the same time, self-employment, ownership of an entity,  undertaking management responsibilities for an entity, or serving in any  management capacity, e.g., on any non-United Nations entity or freelance work are  also covered by the notion of ""occupation"" and ""employment"" and require the  approval of the Secretary-General. Renting out immovable or movable properties  may constitute an occupation, depending on factors such as the number of  properties and the income derived from such activity.   3.   Being on a leave arrangement from an employer other than the United Nations  is also considered ""employment"" or ""occupation"" within the meaning of this  provision, even if no directions are given. Such a leave arrangement would  constitute a conflict of interest and contradict the status of international civil  servants; therefore, it must be disclosed and resolved in the interest of the  Organization. Leave arrangements from government service while working for the  United Nations are addressed in tripartite agreements among the United Nations,  the Government and the staff member. Secondment from government service is  addressed in staff regulation 4.1 and annex II, paragraph (c), of the Staff  Regulations, which provide for the need for supporting documentation on the terms  and conditions of such secondment agreed to by the Member State and the staff  member. Without such agreement, the staff member may be required to cancel the  leave arrangement in the light of his or her status as an international civil servant.   4.   The 2013 standards of conduct clarify that staff members on leave, with or  without pay, from the United Nations should bear in mind that they remain  international civil servants and remain subject to the Organization's regulations and  rules. Therefore, staff may engage in an outside occupation or employment or  outside activity only with express permission from the Organization, including when  on leave (para. 47).   5.   No approval is possible for outside occupation or employment in governmental  service in a political office, in a diplomatic or other representational post or in any  other function not compatible with the staff member's continued status as an  international civil servant. This cannot be authorized in the context of special leave  arrangements under staff rule 5.3 (b). In exceptional circumstances, however, purely  technical functions could be approved at the request of a Government.       ST/SGB/2016/9        23/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.2 (p)      The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to engage in an outside  occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, if:    (i)  The outside occupation or employment does not conflict with the staff  member's official functions or the status of an international civil servant;    (ii) The outside occupation or employment is not against the interest of the  United Nations; and    (iii) The outside occupation or employment is permitted by local law at the  duty station or where the occupation or employment occurs.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (p) sets out in specific terms the Organization's long- standing requirements that must be met before a staff member may be given  permission to engage in an outside occupation or employment. The key factors in  determining whether permission should be granted relate to the compatibility of that  occupation or employment with the status of and the functions being discharged by  the staff member and with the interests of the United Nations (see also paras. 45-49  of the 2013 standards of conduct). In addition, the occupation or employment must  be permitted by local law. If the Secretary-General decides under his discretionary  authority that permission for such occupation or employment should be denied, a  reason will be given.   2.  The first requirement is that there be no conflict with the staff member's  official functions or with the staff member's status as an international civil servant.  For example, it would not be appropriate for a member of the Office of Legal  Affairs to be working part-time in an outside law firm. Another example would be  outside employment with an organization, including a non-governmental one, that  might wish to enter into contractual or other relations with the United Nations. A  conflict between official functions and outside employment can also exist simply in  the need for the staff member to dedicate time to the outside employment, as staff  members are expected -- and remunerated -- to devote their entire work time to the  interest and work of the United Nations and to be available when exigencies of  service so require.   3.  The second requirement is that such occupation or employment not be against  the interest of the United Nations, primarily, that the occupation or employment  does not reflect adversely upon the United Nations. For example, permission would  not be granted for a staff member to work with an organization the goals of which  are incompatible with those of the United Nations or to work in a capacity that  could call into question the impartiality and independence of the staff member. This  is often the case where staff are asked by Governments or public officials to work  for them or organizations or companies related to them while remaining staff  members of the United Nations. Other examples include working for entities the  objectives or work methods or practices of which contradict or are not compatible  with the goals, objectives or values of the Organization. In addition,  non-governmental organizations often follow political interests or seek contractual  links to the Organization that may have to be reviewed when assessing a request by  a staff member. The key element is safeguarding the impartiality of the international  civil servant (see paras. 3-14 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  24/48    4.  The third requirement is that the occupation or employment be permitted  under the law of the duty station concerned. For example, in the United States of  America, staff holding G-4 visas are not permitted under local law to accept outside  employment or to earn money from an occupation, so no permission would be  granted.   5.  Outside activities that relate to the United Nations are regulated through staff  rule 1.2 (t). Outside non-remunerated activities that have nothing to do with a staff  member's official functions would remain at the discretion of the staff member (for  example, the secretary of a stamp club) and normally do not require the approval of  the Secretary-General, unless they have an impact on the staff member's  performance of official duties (see para. 45 of the 2013 standards of conduct).        Use of property and assets        Regulation 1.2 (q)      Staff members shall use the property and assets of the Organization only for  official purposes and shall exercise reasonable care when utilizing such property  and assets.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (q) makes explicit the duty to use reasonable care when  utilizing the property and assets of the Organization; this duty is behind several  provisions in the Financial Rules and the Staff Rules. It includes all property and  assets, including information and communications technology (ICT) that is provided  for official purposes only. As per ST/SGB/2004/15 on use of information and  communication technology resources and data, this also encompasses the ICT  resources and data itself.   2.  Management accountability for the way in which staff resources are utilized is  discussed in the commentary on staff rule 1.3 (a).        Regulation 1.2 (r)      Staff members must respond fully to requests for information from staff  members and other officials of the Organization authorized to investigate the  possible misuse of funds, waste or abuse.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (r) builds on the obligation to supply information set out in  current staff rule 1.5. This provision seeks to ensure that staff members clearly  understand that they must cooperate with official investigations by the Organization  and must supply information on their official actions to, for example, the internal or  external auditors or internal investigators or ad hoc inquiry panels. Such requests  are not in the nature of criminal inquiries where an individual may refuse to answer  on the basis of self-incrimination. The issue in the employment relationship between  a staff member and the Organization is whether the highest standards of  competence, efficiency and integrity required of United Nations staff members have  been met.    ST/SGB/2016/9        25/48  16-12690    2.  The Secretary-General has the authority to request staff to supply information,  and the staff have a duty to do so. This is without prejudice to the rights of staff  under article X of the Staff Regulations and chapter X of the Staff Rules.         Staff rule 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff        General        Rule 1.2 (a)      Staff members shall follow the directions and instructions properly issued by  the Secretary-General and by their supervisors.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (a) deals with the obligation of staff to follow directions properly  given by supervising officials (see paras. 16-20 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  As per the 2013 standards of conduct, staff members must follow the  instructions they receive in connection with their official functions, but also have a  right to ask for written instructions if they have doubts as to the consistency of the  instruction with the Charter or any other constitutional instrument, decisions of the  governing bodies or administrative rules and regulations (para. 19). Although it is  clear that staff must follow instructions, it should also be noted that they have a  right to challenge instructions that they consider to violate their contract of  employment or terms of appointment pursuant to chapter XI of the Staff Rules.  3.  Staff do not have to follow instructions that are manifestly inconsistent with  their official functions or threaten their safety or have nothing to do with their  official activities, since such instructions are not proper. The use of the word  ""properly"" in staff rule 1.2 (a) means that a supervisor who gives improper  instructions will be held accountable. Such cases are rare and can usually be  handled by seeking a review from the supervisor at the next level or by consulting  the Office of Human Resources Management.        Rule 1.2 (b)      Staff members must comply with local laws and honour their private legal  obligations, including, but not limited to, the obligation to honour orders of  competent courts.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) is an amplification of staff regulation 1.1 (f), which provides  that the privileges and immunities of the Organization afford no excuse to staff for  non-performance of their private obligations (see paras. 43 and 44 of the 2013  standards of conduct). The Secretary-General shall determine in any particular case  whether such privileges and immunities exist and, if so, whether they shall be  waived.   2.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) makes clear to staff that they have an obligation to honour  such private legal obligations. This provision assists the Organization effectively in  ensuring that staff respect the applicable laws and court orders relating to their  private obligations, including, but not limited to, obligations under civil  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  26/48    (contract/tort, etc.), family or immigration laws. In the event that a plaintiff  forwards to the Organization a court order against a staff member, the  Administration will seek the views of the staff member before taking any action on  the basis of that order. It is the responsibility of staff who have an order against  them that they contest to avail themselves of all existing means under the applicable  national law to appeal the order and/or obtain relief from the obligation to comply  with the order pending its appeal.  3.  Failure to honour such private obligations may be treated as a disciplinary  matter under article X of the Staff Regulations and chapter X of the Staff Rules. In  cases of non-compliance with family support court orders, deductions from staff  members' salaries, wages and other emoluments may be made in accordance with  the procedures set out in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/1999/4. Other  indebtedness to third parties may also result in deductions made from a staff  member's emoluments under staff rule 3.18 (c).   4.   Non-compliance with private legal obligations can also amount to a staff  member bringing the Organization into disrepute, and staff must act in accordance  with their status at all times.         Rule 1.2 (c)      Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take appropriate  action and to cooperate with duly authorized audits and investigations. Staff  members shall not be retaliated against for complying with these duties.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (c) emphasizes the obligation of all staff members to report  breaches of the Organization's regulations and rules through the designated  reporting channels. At the same time, it manifests the principle of non-retaliation  against staff for having reported breaches of rules by others. Both the duty to report  and the protection from retaliation encourage efforts on the part of all to further the  United Nations as an Organization driven by integrity and transparency. It ensures  that breaches such as embezzlement are brought to the attention of the Organization  by staff who may know about such breaches and who do not have to fear retaliation  for their honesty.         Rule 1.2 (d)      Disciplinary procedures set out in article X of the Staff Regulations and  chapter X of the Staff Rules may be instituted against a staff member who fails to  comply with his or her obligations and the standards of conduct set out in the  Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial  Regulations and Rules, and administrative issuances.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (d) ensures that staff are held accountable through disciplinary  procedures for failure to comply with their obligations and the standards of conduct  set out in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the  Financial Regulations and Rules and all related issuances. Administrative issuances    ST/SGB/2016/9        27/48  16-12690    refer to issuances promulgated by the Secretary-General, or by those who hold  authority delegated by the Secretary-General, in furtherance of the Staff  Regulations and  Rules  and  the  Financial  Regulations  and  Rules  (see  ST/SGB/2009/4).        Specific instances of prohibited conduct        Rule 1.2 (e)      Sexual exploitation and abuse is prohibited. Sexual activity with children  (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or the  age of consent locally, except where a staff member is legally married to a person  who is under the age of 18 but over the age of majority or consent in his or her  country of citizenship. Mistaken belief in the age of a child is not a defence. The  exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex, including sexual  favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour, is  prohibited. United Nations staff members are obliged to create and maintain an  environment that prevents sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.        Commentary      Staff rules 1.2 (e)-(k) address specific instances of prohibited conduct. Staff  rule 1.2 (e) was added to address the Organization's serious and growing concern  over sexual exploitation and abuse. Sexual exploitation and abuse is listed as a  matter of serious misconduct under staff regulation 10.1 (b). Staff rule 1.2 (e)  reflects the importance that the Organization attaches to preventing and addressing  cases of exploitation and abuse, in line with the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance  policy.         Rule 1.2 (f)      Any form of discrimination or harassment, including sexual or gender  harassment, as well as abuse in any form at the workplace or in connection with  work, is prohibited.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (f) reproduces the core of Secretary-General's bulletin  ST/SGB/2008/5, which sets out United Nations policy on equal treatment of men and  women in the Secretariat, and which also prohibits all forms of discrimination,  harassment, including sexual harassment, and abuse of authority (see also  paras. 15, 21 and 22 of the 2013 standards of conduct). The clarification ""in any  form"" emphasizes that acts of abuse and harassment may take many forms and are  not limited to physical or verbal abuse.   2.   All dealings among staff members should be governed by the principles of  dignity and mutual respect. Inappropriate behaviour that does not comport with  these standards should be addressed by managers and supervisors, irrespective of  whether the behaviour may rise to the level of abuse. This follows from their  obligation in positions of leadership to ensure a harmonious workplace based on  mutual respect (see paras. 16 and 21 of the 2013 standards of conduct).       ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  28/48        Rule 1.2 (g)      Staff members shall not disrupt or otherwise interfere with any meeting or  other official activity of the Organization, including activity in connection with the  administration of justice system, nor shall staff members threaten, intimidate or  otherwise engage in any conduct intended, directly or indirectly, to interfere with  the ability of other staff members to discharge their official functions. Staff  members shall not threaten, retaliate or attempt to retaliate against such individuals  or against staff members exercising their rights and duties under the present Rules.         Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (g) prohibits actions that threaten, intimidate or interfere with  official functions and activities, as well as any act that would constitute retaliation  or attempted retaliation.   2.  The rule is not intended to prevent permitted activities in the exercise of rights  such as the right of staff to peaceful assembly, the right of representatives of staff  bodies to address the Fifth Committee or other organs that have authorized such  procedures, or the right of staff to meet in authorized meeting rooms. What is  prohibited are actions by staff members that prevent Member States, departments,  offices, staff and other authorized persons from holding a meeting or carrying out  an official activity. Ultimately, the applicability of the rule will be determined on a  case-by-case basis, but the test is reasonably clear in that conduct which prevents  others from performing official functions is not permitted.  3.  It is noted that at times staff representatives have for certain periods  suspended participation in joint bodies. Withdrawal by staff representatives from  joint bodies does not constitute interference with official functions, as in such cases  the Administration may proceed without the consultation normally needed pursuant  to article VIII of the Staff Regulations and chapter VIII of the Staff Rules.  4.   The last sentence of staff rule 1.2 (g) emphasizes the importance of the  Organization's policy prohibiting acts or attempts of retaliation (see also staff  rule 1.2 (c)).         Rule 1.2 (h)      Staff members shall not intentionally misrepresent their functions, official title  or the nature of their duties to Member States or to any entities or persons external  to the United Nations.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (h) prohibits the intentional misrepresentation of official title or  duties to outside parties, for example, by placing misleading titles on business  cards, usually for private advantage. The use of the word ""intentional"" makes clear  that this prohibition does not extend to accidental or inadvertent actions.  2.   While the rule expressly prohibits misrepresentation towards third parties,  such intentional misrepresentation towards other staff members is also prohibited.  3.   Accordingly, staff members should use the functional or official title  associated with the position they hold within the Organization, and refrain from    ST/SGB/2016/9        29/48  16-12690    using academic, professional or honorific titles such as prefixes or suffixes in their  presentation towards others when acting on official business.         Rule 1.2 (i)      Staff members shall not intentionally alter, destroy, falsify or misplace or  render useless any official document, record or file entrusted to them by virtue of  their functions, which document, record or file is intended to be kept as part of the  records of the Organization.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (i) puts staff on notice that the intentional unauthorized  destruction, alteration, falsification or misplacement or other means of rendering  useless any records that were intended to form part of the official files of the  Organization, or a department or office, is prohibited. This has been a problem from  time to time in disciplinary cases or audits when key documents have been found to  be missing from official files of the Organization. The use of the word ""intentional""  makes clear that this is not a careless or accidental act. The word ""falsify"" has  been added to include cases where staff members may forge records or falsify  documents, for example, to claim benefits to which they were not entitled. Such  prohibited acts may also constitute fraud. Records or files include electronic records  or files and e-mail or other server-based records.         Rule 1.2 (j)      Staff members shall not seek to influence Member States, principal or  subsidiary organs of the United Nations or expert groups in order to obtain a change  from a position or decision taken by the Secretary-General, including decisions  relating to the financing of Secretariat programmes or units, or in order to secure  support for improving their personal situation or the personal situation of other staff  members or for blocking or reversing unfavourable decisions regarding their status  or their colleagues' status.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (j) seeks to make clear that the lobbying of Member States by  individual staff members against positions taken by the Secretary-General is not  permitted (see also paras. 27-29 and 31 of the 2013 standards of conduct). This  includes lobbying Member States to intervene in the administration of justice on  behalf of a staff member.   2.  The General Assembly has recognized the importance of its informal  interaction with staff representatives in human resources management issues. Such  informal interactions with Member States by elected officials acting in staff  representative functions are not prohibited by staff rule 1.2 (j).         Rule 1.2 (k)      Staff members shall neither offer nor promise any favour, gift, remuneration or  any other personal benefit to another staff member or to any third party with a view  to causing him or her to perform, fail to perform or delay the performance of any  official act. Similarly, staff members shall neither seek nor accept any favour, gift,  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  30/48    remuneration or any other personal benefit from another staff member or from any  third party in exchange for performing, failing to perform or delaying the  performance of any official act.        Commentary      The prohibition in staff rule 1.2 (k) applies to a staff member's relations with  other staff members and with third parties. While the general proposition is that the  practices described in the rule violate the highest standards of integrity required of  staff members (see paras. 17, 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of conduct), the  purpose of this rule is specifically to deal with the perversion and abuse of power,  influence-peddling and other improper or even corrupt practices. Offering or  accepting any favour, gift, remuneration or other incentive with the intention of  obtaining the performance, non-performance or delaying of official duties by the  staff member may, and in most cases does, constitute bribery and/or other forms of  misconduct.         Honours, gifts or remuneration        Rule 1.2 (l)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government. However, if refusal of an unanticipated honour,  decoration, favour or gift from a Government would cause embarrassment to the  Organization, the staff member may receive it on behalf of the Organization  provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General through  established procedures.         Commentary      Rule 1.2 (l) reiterates the prohibition on accepting any honour, decoration,  favour, gift or remuneration from any Government stipulated in staff regulation 1.2 (j)  and (k). The only possible exception is a situation in which a staff member is  presented with an unanticipated honour, decoration, etc., by a government official  and refusal to accept it would cause unnecessary embarrassment to the  Organization. In such a situation, the presented gift or award, etc., may be accepted  formally on behalf of the Organization, rather than on behalf of the individual staff  member. Staff members must report such receipt of gifts or honours, etc., and  entrust them to the Secretary-General through the established procedures.h See also  staff regulation 1.2 (j) above and the commentary on staff rule 1.2 (m) below.         Rule 1.2 (m)      Acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from non-governmental sources requires the prior approval of the  Secretary-General. Approval shall be granted only in exceptional cases and where  such acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the Organization and with  the staff member's status as an international civil servant. If circumstances do not  allow for prior approval or if refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour  or gift, including a minor gift of essentially nominal value, would cause  __________________    h  See ST/AI/2010/1 on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources.    ST/SGB/2016/9        31/48  16-12690    embarrassment to the Organization, staff members may receive it on behalf of the  Organization provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General  through established procedures. See also staff regulation 1.2 (l) and the commentary  thereon.        Commentary    1.  The intended purpose of the staff regulations and rules dealing with honours,  decorations,  favours,  gifts  or  remuneration  from  governmental  and  non-governmental sources is to ensure the independence and impartiality of staff  members. Latitude is allowed in connection with such honours, decorations, etc.,  from non-governmental sources only when the prior approval of the Secretary- General is obtained for accepting an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration, as stipulated in staff rule 1.2 (m), which implements staff regulation  1.2 (l). Staff rule 1.2 (m) provides guidance on the conditions under which honours,  decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration may be accepted from non-governmental  sources (see also paras. 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of conduct). In essence,  advance approval is required and will be granted only in exceptional cases and only  where acceptance would not compromise the interests of the Organization or the  status of the staff member as an international civil servant. The only exceptions are  situations in which obtaining prior approval is not possible, as may be the case with  honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from Governments (see staff  regulation 1.2 (j) and (k) above) and refusal of the unanticipated honour, etc., would  cause embarrassment to the Organization. Only in such a case may the honour, etc.,  be accepted by the staff member, but only and expressly on behalf of the  Organization. Honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration must in all  cases be reported to the Secretary-General and entrusted to him through the  established procedures.i   2.  Acceptance of a gift, etc., outside these parameters may result in an  instruction to the staff member to return it, unless in turn this may cause  embarrassment to the Organization. Staff members are, therefore, expected to  consult with their administering official prior to accepting any gifts, etc., under this  rule.   3.  Any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration relating to the  performance of official functions should be directed to the Organization, not to an  individual staff member, and should be so designated.         Rule 1.2 (n)      The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to accept from a  non-governmental source or a university or a related institution, academic awards,  distinctions and tokens of a commemorative or honorary character, such as scrolls,  certificates, trophies or other items of essentially nominal monetary value.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (n) provides the Secretary-General with limited authority to  allow staff members to accept certain awards, distinctions and tokens from a  non-governmental source or from a university. The rule provides that, for the  __________________    i  Ibid.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  32/48    purpose of the rule, universities or related institutions are not considered  governmental sources since, in many countries, they are not so considered and it  would be incongruous for a staff member to be authorized to accept an honorary  degree or certification from universities in some, but not all, countries. Therefore,  the Secretary-General would normally grant authorization to accept an honorary  degree or certificate from any university or related institution that is recognized as  an academic institution by the Secretary-General. For example, no approval would  be granted for honours from so-called ""diploma mills"" or institutions not  recognized by a competent national authority.         Rule 1.2 (o)      Staff members, as part of their official functions, will be expected from time to  time to attend governmental or other functions such as meetings, conferences, meals  and diplomatic receptions. Such attendance is not considered receipt of a favour,  gift or remuneration within the meaning of the Staff Regulations and Rules.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (o) addresses the issue of attendance at various official  functions. It is clear that international officials are required from time to time to  attend governmental or other luncheons, dinners and diplomatic receptions. Such  attendance will not be considered by the Secretary-General to be a favour, gift or  remuneration within the meaning of staff regulation 1.2 (j)-(l). However, such  attendance or receipt of hospitality favours from non-governmental sources is  limited under staff rule 1.2 (p) (see below).        Rule 1.2 (p)      Staff members shall not accept any gift, remuneration or favour from any  source having or seeking to have any type of contractual relationship with the  Organization.         Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (p) emphasizes the importance of staff not accepting any gift,  remuneration or favour from any source (governmental or non-governmental,  including universities) that has sought or seeks a contractual relationship with the  Organization. This includes gifts from vendors or implementing partners, such as  non-governmental organizations. The acceptance of hospitality favours from  sources that have sought or seek such contractual relations is prohibited. In  addition, for staff performing relevant functions that would enable them to influence  such contractual relations, the acceptance of any favour, including meals or  participation in a reception sponsored by a relevant party, could also be seen as  creating a possible conflict of interest under staff rule 1.2 (q) and must be avoided.         Conflict of interest        Rule 1.2 (q)      A staff member whose personal interests interfere with the performance of his  or her official duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and  impartiality required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant    ST/SGB/2016/9        33/48  16-12690    shall disclose any such actual or possible interest to the head of office and, except as  otherwise authorized by the Secretary-General, formally excuse himself or herself  from participating with regard to any involvement in that matter which might give  rise to a conflict of interest situation.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (q) contains a definition of ""conflict of interest"" that is aligned  with the Staff Regulations. The objective of the provision is to compel the disclosure  and disposition of any actual or possible conflict of interest in a transparent  manner. Where a conflict is so identified, the staff member must comply with  instructions on how to resolve the matter, as all staff have the obligation to avoid  conflicts of interest. This definition is complemented by the definition set out in the  2013 standards of conduct (para. 23). See also the commentary on staff regulation  1.2 (m) above.         Rule 1.2 (r)      Pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (n), the Secretary-General shall establish  procedures for the filing and utilization of financial disclosure statements.        Commentary      On the basis of staff rule 1.2 (r), the Secretary-General has established  procedures to implement the filing of financial disclosure statements with due regard  to the necessary confidentiality of such forms. The programme is administered by the  Ethics Office.j See also the commentary on staff regulation 1.2 (n) above.         Outside activities        Rule 1.2 (s)      Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment,  whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General.         Rule 1.2 (t)      Staff members shall not, except in the normal course of official duties or with  the prior approval of the Secretary-General, engage in any outside activities that  relate to the purpose, activities or interests of the United Nations. Outside activities  include but are not limited to:     (i)  Issuing statements to the press, radio or other agencies of public  information;    (ii) Accepting speaking engagements;    (iii) Taking part in film, theatre, radio or television productions;    (iv) Submitting articles, books or other material for publication, or for any  electronic dissemination.    Approval may be granted in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (p).     __________________    j  See ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment and terms of reference"".  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  34/48        Commentary    1.  Staff rules 1.2 (s) and (t) distinguish between outside occupation or  employment and outside activities that relate to the purpose, activities or interests  of the United Nations. In either case, the staff member must request the approval of  the Secretary-General. If a request is denied, a reason for that refusal will be given  (see paras. 45-49 of the 2013 standards of conduct).  2.   Staff rule 1.2 (t) includes in its scope any type of outside activity that relates to  the purpose, activities or interests of the Organization, not limited to the list of  examples of specific events or engagements provided in the rule. Staff rule 1.2 (t) (iv)  further clarifies that the electronic dissemination of material for publication, for  example, via e-mail or on public websites, also requires the approval of the  Secretary-General. This includes contemporary means of dissemination of  information through the Internet and social media. Where approved, public  dissemination in any form must bear appropriate disclaimers, such as ""The views  expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of  the United Nations,"" unless the staff member has been requested, as part of the  approval, not to disclose his or her affiliation with the Organization. Further, any  publication in any form that can be associated with the author as a staff member of  the Organization should bear an appropriate disclaimer.   3.  Outside activities that are of benefit to the Organization or the achievement of  its goals and contribute to the development of the professional skills of staff  members are usually not only permitted, but also encouraged, for example, the  approved publication of scholarly articles or participation in symposiums. Publicly  available statements of United Nations officials, even in their private capacity, may  have a significant impact on the image and reputation of the Organization. For  publications, approval not only for the activity as such, but also for the manuscript  prior to publication, is required if it relates to the purpose, activities or interests of  the United Nations.   4.   For approved outside activities that relate to the purpose, activities or  interests of the Organization, only subsistence allowances similar to those payable  by the United Nations may be accepted by the staff member. No other remuneration  may be accepted. This serves to support the independence and impartiality expected  of staff members when they engage in United Nations-related activities, given their  status as international civil servants (see also staff rule 1.2 (w) below).   5.   Staff members are reminded that outside activities shall not compromise the  confidentiality of the Organization's information. They shall not communicate to  any person any information known to them by reason of their official position that  has not been made public, except with the permission of the Secretary-General. This  obligation does not cease upon separation from the Organization. In this context,  staff members may be required to sign an appropriate confidentiality statement  prior to engaging in the activity or to ensure that no references to their affiliation  with the Organization will be displayed in relevant public forums.   6.   Approval is a discretionary decision by the Secretary-General and may take  into account information and assessments by the employing office or department,  the Ethics Office, the Office of Human Resources Management and/or the Office of  Legal Affairs as well as any other relevant substantive offices or departments.       ST/SGB/2016/9        35/48  16-12690        Rule 1.2 (u)      Membership in a political party is permitted, provided that such membership  does not entail action, or an obligation to take action, by the staff member contrary  to staff regulation 1.2 (h). The payment of normal financial contributions to a  political party shall not be construed as an activity inconsistent with the principles  set out in staff regulation 1.2 (h).        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (u) clarifies the staff member's rights and obligations vis-a-vis  political activities (see also paras. 48 and 49 of the 2013 standards of conduct and  the commentary on staff regulation 1.2 (h) above).        Rule 1.2 (v)      The Secretary-General shall establish procedures whereby staff may seek in  confidence clarification as to whether proposed outside activities would conflict  with their status as international civil servants.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (v) seeks to assist staff in determining whether there are conflict  situations by requiring the establishment of procedures to enable the staff to seek  confidential guidance on such issues (see also paras. 45 and 48 of the 2013  standards of conduct). Staff members may reach out to the Ethics Office for  guidance.k         Travel and per diem for outside activities        Rule 1.2 (w)      Staff members who are authorized by the Secretary-General to participate in  activities related to the work of the Organization which are organized by a  Government, intergovernmental organization, non-governmental organization or  other private source may receive from that organizing entity accommodation, travel  and subsistence allowance generally in line with those payable by the United  Nations. In such cases the daily subsistence allowance that may otherwise be  payable by the United Nations shall be reduced as envisaged in staff rule 7.10 (a).        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (w) addresses invitations routinely extended by Governments,  intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental institutions or other private  sources to the Secretary-General and staff members to attend conferences or  meetings or undertake other activities dealing with United Nations-related matters.  Attendance at such events is normally authorized by the Secretary-General, and the  rule reflects that current practice. It also provides an opportunity for the  Organization to save on allowances that may be payable by the Organization by  having the accommodation or travel and subsistence allowance provided by the  Government, intergovernmental organization, non-governmental organization or  private source and by reducing the travel subsistence allowance that may otherwise  __________________    k  See ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment and terms of reference"".  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  36/48    be payable to the staff member. The rule limits the permissible compensation that  staff members may accept, when participating in United Nations-related activities,  from sources other than the United Nations for travel, accommodation and  subsistence to ensure the independence and impartiality expected of staff members,  given their status as international civil servants. In this regard, it would be  improper to accept from governmental or non-governmental sources higher levels of  compensation than are allowed by the United Nations for its staff for travel on  official business.        Staff regulation 1.3      Performance of staff        Regulation 1.3 (a)      Staff members are accountable to the Secretary-General for the proper  discharge of their functions. Staff members are required to uphold the highest  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the discharge of their functions.  Their performance will be appraised periodically to ensure that the required  standards of performance are met.        Commentary    1.  Much of staff regulation 1.3 deals with the standards of performance required  of staff members and provides that they will be evaluated and held accountable for  meeting the required standards established by the Charter. Since the separately  administered funds and programmes have systems for assessing performance that  are adapted to meet their special needs, the provisions of staff regulation 1.3 (a)  must remain very general. The regulation places on managers the responsibility to  make proper appraisals of performance, which reinforces the solid legislative basis  for such procedures and practices.  2.  Staff regulation 1.3 (a) makes it clear that staff members are required to  uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the  discharge of their functions (see Article 101 of the Charter and paras. 3-14 and 52- 54 of the 2013 standards of conduct). The regulation emphasizes the concept of  accountability for performance as a fundamental condition of service. In this  context, the General Assembly adopted a definition of accountability in its  resolution 64/259:     ""Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be  answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception.    ""Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a  timely and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all  mandates to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental  bodies and other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all  resolutions, regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective,  accurate and timely reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship  of funds and resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined  system of rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important    ST/SGB/2016/9        37/48  16-12690    role of the oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted  recommendations.""  3.  The relationship between integrity and performance is discussed in the  commentary on staff rule 1.3 (a) below.  4.  An integral part of the performance of managers is to manage properly the  human, financial and other resources entrusted to them. It should be emphasized  that the higher level of responsibility associated with the managerial functions of  managers entails a commensurate increase in their accountability for the proper  performance of all their duties in managing the human and financial resources  entrusted to them.        Regulation 1.3 (b)      The whole time of staff members shall be at the disposal of the Secretary- General for the performance of official functions. The Secretary-General shall  establish a normal working week and shall establish official holidays for each duty  station. Exceptions may be made by the Secretary-General as the needs of the  service may require, and staff members shall be required to work beyond the normal  tour of duty when requested to do so.        Commentary      Staff regulation 1.3 (b) makes it clear that, although staff normally work an  ordinary working week, they must work in excess of that working week when so  directed. Any requests to work additional hours must be reasonable and must be  related to the needs of the service.        Staff rule 1.3      Performance of staff members        Rule 1.3 (a)      Staff members shall be evaluated for their efficiency, competence and integrity  through performance appraisal mechanisms that shall assess the staff member's  compliance with the standards set out in the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules for  purposes of accountability.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.3 (a) makes explicit that the efficiency, competence and integrity  required of staff by the Charter and staff regulation 1.3 (a) will be evaluated and  that they will be held accountable to maintain the required standards.  2.  Generally speaking, an appraisal relates primarily to efficiency and  competence, but integrity is part of the essential characteristic of an international  civil servant and may have an impact on the performance of official duties. For  example, abusive conduct by a staff member towards his or her colleagues is not  excused even if the staff member is efficient. On the other hand, the staff member 's  personal life is generally of no concern to a supervisor unless there is an impact on  the discharge of his or her functions or on his or her role as an international civil  servant. As noted in the 2013 standards of conduct:  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  38/48      ""4. International  civil  servants  should  share  the  vision  of  their  organizations. It is loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and  international outlook of international civil servants; a shared vision  guarantees that they will place the interests of their organization above their  own and use its resources in a responsible manner.    ""5. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  embraces all aspects of an international civil servant's behaviour, including  such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These  qualities are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in  the Charter.""  3.  It is important to note that competence and efficiency of staff include not only  the way in which they perform their tasks, but the way in which they interact with  others. As noted in the 2013 standards of conduct, the obligations of staff towards  their supervisors, and of supervisors towards their staff, are of crucial importance.  Those duties and obligations bear repeating in this commentary:    ""16. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their  responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect;  they should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of  staff are properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is  particularly important when staff are subject to criticism arising from the  performance of their duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and  motivating their staff and promoting their development.    ""17. Managers and supervisors serve as role models and they have therefore a  special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It is quite  improper for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their staff; they must  act impartially, without favouritism and intimidation. In matters relating to the  appointment or career of others, international civil servants should not try to  influence colleagues for personal reasons.    ""18. Managers and supervisors should communicate effectively with their  staff and share relevant information with them. International civil servants  have a reciprocal responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and information  to their supervisors and to abide by and defend any decisions taken, even when  those do not accord with their personal views.    ""19. International civil servants must follow the instructions they receive in  connection with their official functions and, if they have doubts as to whether  an instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional  instrument, decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and  regulations, they should first consult their supervisors. If the international  civil servant and supervisor cannot agree, the international civil servant may  ask for written instructions. These may be challenged through the proper  institutional mechanisms, but any challenge should not delay carrying out the  instruction. International civil servants may also record their views in official  files. They should not follow verbal or written instructions that are manifestly  inconsistent with their official functions or that threaten their safety or that of  others.    ""20. International civil servants have the duty to report any breach of the  organization's regulations and rules to the official or entity within their    ST/SGB/2016/9        39/48  16-12690    organizations whose responsibility it is to take appropriate action, and to  cooperate with duly authorized audits and investigations. An international  civil servant who reports such a breach in good faith or who cooperates with  an audit or investigation has the right to be protected against retaliation for  doing so.""  4.  It should be emphasized that supervisors will be assessed not only on their  technical competence, but also on the way in which they utilize the staff placed  under their direction.        Rule 1.3 (b)      The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that appropriate learning and  development programmes are available for the benefit of staff.        Commentary      As staff are required to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity, it follows that during their careers the Secretary-General must seek to  ensure that staff are provided with appropriate learning and development  opportunities to assist them in meeting the challenges of responding effectively to  the changing mandates of the Organization.        Rule 1.3 (c)      Performance reports shall be prepared regularly for all staff members,  including at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above, in accordance with  procedures promulgated by the Secretary-General.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.3 (c) provides that performance appraisal will be pursuant to  procedures promulgated by the Secretary-General.        IV. Standards of conduct for the international civil service, 2013          Introduction    1.  The United Nations and the specialized agencies embody the highest  aspirations of the peoples of the world. Their aim is to save succeeding generations  from the scourge of war and to enable every man, woman and child to live in  dignity and freedom.  2.  The international civil service bears responsibility for translating these ideals  into reality. It relies on the great traditions of public administration that have grown  up in member States: competence, integrity, impartiality, independence and  discretion. But over and above this, international civil servants have a special  calling: to serve the ideals of peace, respect for fundamental rights, economic and  social progress, and international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on  international civil servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for,  ultimately, it is the international civil service that will enable the United Nations  system to bring about a just and peaceful world.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  40/48        Guiding principles    3.  The values that are enshrined in the United Nations organizations must also be  those that guide international civil servants in all their actions: fundamental human  rights, social justice, the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for the  equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small.   4.  International civil servants should share the vision of their organizations. It is  loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and international outlook of  international civil servants; a shared vision guarantees that they will place the  interests of their organization above their own and use its resources in a responsible  manner.  5.  The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  embraces all aspects of an international civil servant's behaviour, including such  qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These qualities  are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in the Charter.  6.  Tolerance and understanding are basic human values. They are essential for  international civil servants, who must respect all persons equally, without any  distinction whatsoever. This respect fosters a climate and a working environment  sensitive to the needs of all. To achieve this in a multicultural setting calls for a  positive affirmation going well beyond passive acceptance.  7.  International loyalty means loyalty to the whole United Nations system and  not only to the organization for which one works; international civil servants have  an obligation to understand and exemplify this wider loyalty. The need for a  cooperative and understanding attitude towards international civil servants of other  United Nations organizations is obviously most important where international civil  servants of several organizations are serving in the same country or region.   8.  If the impartiality of the international civil service is to be maintained,  international civil servants must remain independent of any authority outside their  organization; their conduct must reflect that independence. In keeping with their  oath of office, they should not seek nor should they accept instructions from any  Government, person or entity external to the organization. It cannot be too strongly  stressed that international civil servants are not, in any sense, representatives of  Governments or other entities, nor are they proponents of their policies. This applies  equally to those on secondment from Governments and to those whose services  have been made available from elsewhere. International civil servants should be  constantly aware that through their allegiance to the Charter and the corresponding  instruments of each organization, member States and their representatives are  committed to respect this independent status.  9.  Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with  political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate,  international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take sides  or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either individually  or as members of a group, irrespective of the medium used. This can mean that, in  certain situations, personal views should be expressed only with tact and discretion.  10. This does not mean that international civil servants have to give up their  personal political views or national perspectives. It does mean, however, that they    ST/SGB/2016/9        41/48  16-12690    must at all times maintain a broad international outlook and an understanding of the  international community as a whole.  11.  The independence of the international civil service does not conflict with, or  obscure, the fact that it is the member States that collectively make up -- in some  cases with other constituents -- the organization. Conduct that furthers good  relations with individual member States and that contributes to their trust and  confidence in the organizations' secretariat strengthens the organizations and  promotes their interest.  12. International civil servants who are responsible for projects in particular  countries or regions may be called upon to exercise special care in maintaining their  independence. At times they might receive instructions from the host country but  this should not compromise their independence. If at any time they consider that  such instructions threaten their independence, they must consult their supervisors.  13. International civil servants at all levels are accountable and answerable for all  actions carried out, as well as decisions taken, and commitments made by them in  performing their functions.  14. An international outlook stems from an understanding of and loyalty to the  objectives and purposes of the organizations of the United Nations system as set  forth in their legal instruments. It implies, inter alia, respect for the right of others to  hold different points of view and follow different cultural practices. It requires a  willingness to work without bias with persons of all nationalities, religions and  cultures; it calls for constant sensitivity as to how words and actions may look to  others. It requires avoidance of any expressions that could be interpreted as biased  or intolerant. As working methods can be different in different cultures,  international civil servants should not be wedded to the attitudes, working methods  or work habits of their own country or region.   15. Freedom from discrimination is a basic human right. International civil  servants are expected to respect the dignity, worth and equality of all people without  any distinction whatsoever. Assumptions based on stereotypes must be assiduously  avoided. One of the main tenets of the Charter is the equality of men and women,  and organizations should therefore do their utmost to promote gender equality.        Working relations    16. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their  responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect; they  should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of staff are  properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is particularly  important when staff are subject to criticism arising from the performance of their  duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and motivating their staff and  promoting their development.  17. Managers and supervisors serve as role models and they have therefore a  special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It is quite improper  for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their staff; they must act impartially,  without favouritism and intimidation. In matters relating to the appointment or  career of others, international civil servants should not try to influence colleagues  for personal reasons.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  42/48    18. Managers and supervisors should communicate effectively with their staff and  share relevant information with them. International civil servants have a reciprocal  responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and information to their supervisors and  to abide by and defend any decisions taken, even when those do not accord with  their personal views.  19. International civil servants must follow the instructions they receive in  connection with their official functions and, if they have doubts as to whether an  instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional instrument,  decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and regulations, they  should first consult their supervisors. If the international civil servant and  supervisor cannot agree, the international civil servant may ask for written  instructions. These may be challenged through the proper institutional mechanisms,  but any challenge should not delay carrying out the instruction. International civil  servants may also record their views in official files. They should not follow verbal  or written instructions that are manifestly inconsistent with their official functions  or that threaten their safety or that of others.  20. International civil servants have the duty to report any breach of the  organization's regulations and rules to the official or entity within their  organizations whose responsibility it is to take appropriate action, and to cooperate  with duly authorized audits and investigations. An international civil servant who  reports such a breach in good faith or who cooperates with an audit or investigation  has the right to be protected against retaliation for doing so.        Harassment and abuse of authority    21. Harassment in any shape or form is an affront to human dignity and  international civil servants must not engage in any form of harassment. International  civil servants have the right to a workplace environment free of harassment or  abuse. All organizations must prohibit any kind of harassment. Organizations have a  duty to establish rules and provide guidance on what constitutes harassment and  abuse of authority and how unacceptable behaviour will be addressed.  22. International civil servants must not abuse their authority or use their power or  position in a manner that is offensive, humiliating, embarrassing or intimidating to  another person.        Conflict of interest    23.  Conflicts of interest may occur when an international civil servant's personal  interests interfere with the performance of his/her official duties or call into  question the qualities of integrity, independence and impartiality required by the  status of an international civil servant. Conflicts of interest include circumstances in  which international civil servants, directly or indirectly, may benefit improperly, or  allow a third party to benefit improperly, from their association with their  organization. Conflicts of interest can arise from an international civil servant's  personal or familial dealings with third parties, individuals, beneficiaries, or other  institutions. If a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest does arise, the  conflict shall be disclosed, addressed and resolved in the best interest of the  organization. Questions entailing a conflict of interest can be very sensitive and  need to be treated with care.      ST/SGB/2016/9        43/48  16-12690        Disclosure of information    24.  International civil servants should avoid assisting third parties in their dealings  with their organization where this might lead to actual or perceived preferential  treatment. This is particularly important in procurement matters or when negotiating  prospective employment. At times, international civil servants may, owing to their  position or functions in accordance with the organization's policies, be required to  disclose certain personal assets if this is necessary to enable their organizations to  make sure that there is no conflict. The organizations must ensure confidentiality of  any information so disclosed, and must use it only for defined purposes or as  authorized by the international civil servant concerned. International civil servants  should also disclose in advance possible conflicts of interest that may arise in the  course of carrying out their duties and seek advice on mitigation and remediation.  They should perform their official duties and conduct their personal affairs in a  manner that preserves and enhances public confidence in their own integrity and  that of their organization.        Use of the resources of United Nations organizations    25.  International civil servants are responsible for safeguarding the resources of  United Nations organizations which are to be used for the purpose of delivering an  organization's mandate and to advance the best interests of the organization.  International civil servants shall use the assets, property, information and other  resources of their organizations for authorized purposes only and with care. Limited  personal use of the resources of an organization, such as electronic and  communications resources, may be permitted by the organization in accordance with  applicable policies.        Post-employment restrictions    26.  After leaving service with organizations of the United Nations system,  international civil servants should not take improper advantage of their former  official functions and positions, including through unauthorized use or distribution  of privileged or confidential information; nor should international civil servants,  including those working in procurement services and as requisitioning officers,  attempt to unduly influence the decisions of the organization in the interest or at the  request of third parties with a view to seeking an opportunity to be employed by  such third parties.        Role of the secretariats (headquarters and field duty stations)    27. The main function of all secretariats is to assist legislative bodies in their work  and to carry out their decisions. The executive heads are responsible for directing  and controlling the work of the secretariats. Accordingly, when submitting proposals  or advocating positions before a legislative body or committee, international civil  servants are presenting the position of the executive head, not that of an individual  or organizational unit.  28. In providing services to a legislative or representative body, international civil  servants should serve only the interests of the organization, not that of an individual  or organizational unit. It would not be appropriate for international civil servants to  prepare for government or other international civil service representatives any  speeches, arguments or proposals on questions under discussion without approval of  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  44/48    the executive head. It could, however, be quite appropriate to provide factual  information, technical advice or assistance with such tasks as the preparation of  draft resolutions.  29. It is entirely improper for international civil servants to lobby or seek support  from government representatives or members of legislative organs to obtain  advancement either for themselves or for others or to block or reverse unfavourable  decisions regarding their status. By adhering to the Charter and the constitutions of  the organizations of the United Nations system, Governments have undertaken to  safeguard the independence of the international civil service; it is therefore  understood that government representatives and members of legislative bodies will  neither accede to such requests nor intervene in such matters. The proper method for  an international civil servant to address such matters is through administrative  channels; each organization is responsible for providing these.        Staff-management relations    30. An enabling environment is essential for constructive staff-management  relations and serves the interests of the organizations. Relations between  management and staff should be guided by mutual respect. Elected staff  representatives have a cardinal role to play in the consideration of conditions of  employment and work, as well as in matters of staff welfare. Freedom of association  is a fundamental human right and international civil servants have the right to form  and join associations, unions or other groupings to promote and defend their  interests. Continuing dialogue between staff and management is indispensable.  Management should facilitate this dialogue.  31. Elected staff representatives enjoy rights that derive from their status; this may  include the opportunity to address legislative organs of their organization. These  rights should be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Charter of the  United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international  covenants on human rights, and does not undermine the independence and integrity  of the international civil service. In using the broad freedom of expression they  enjoy, staff representatives must exercise a sense of responsibility and avoid undue  criticism of the organization.  32. Staff representatives must be protected against discriminatory or prejudicial  treatment based on their status or activities as staff representatives, both during their  term of office and after it has ended. Organizations should avoid unwarranted  interference in the administration of their staff unions or associations.        Relations with member States and legislative bodies    33. It is the clear duty of all international civil servants to maintain the best  possible relations with Governments and avoid any action that might impair this.  They should not interfere in the policies or affairs of Governments. It is  unacceptable for them, either individually or collectively, to criticize or try to  discredit a Government. At the same time, it is understood that international civil  servants may speak freely in support of their organizations' policies. Any activity,  direct or indirect, to undermine or overthrow a Government constitutes serious  misconduct.    ST/SGB/2016/9        45/48  16-12690    34. International civil servants are not representatives of their countries, nor do  they have authority to act as liaison agents between organizations of the United  Nations system and their Governments. The executive head may, however, request  an international civil servant to undertake such duties, a unique role for which  international loyalty and integrity are essential. For their part, neither Governments  nor organizations should place international civil servants in a position where their  international and national loyalties may conflict.         Relations with the public    35. For an organization of the United Nations system to function successfully, it  must have the support of the public. All international civil servants therefore have a  continuing responsibility to promote a better understanding of the objectives and  work of their organizations. This requires them to be well informed of the  achievements of their own organizations and to familiarize themselves with the  work of the United Nations system as a whole.  36. There is a risk that on occasion international civil servants may be subject to  criticism from outside their organizations; in keeping with their responsibility as  international civil servants, they should respond with tact and restraint. It is the  obligation of their organizations to defend them against criticism for actions taken  in fulfilment of their duties.  37. It would not be proper for international civil servants to air personal  grievances or criticize their organizations in public. International civil servants  should endeavour at all times to promote a positive image of the international civil  service, in conformity with their oath of loyalty.        Relations with the media    38. Openness and transparency in relations with the media are effective means of  communicating the organizations' messages. The organizations should have  guidelines and procedures in place for which the following principles should apply:  international civil servants should regard themselves as speaking in the name of  their organizations and avoid personal references and views; in no circumstances  should they use the media to further their own interests, to air their own grievances,  to reveal unauthorized information or to attempt to influence their organizations'  policy decisions.        Use and protection of information    39. Because disclosure of confidential information may seriously jeopardize the  efficiency and credibility of an organization, international civil servants are  responsible for exercising discretion in all matters of official business. They must  not divulge confidential information without authorization. International civil  servants should not use information to personal advantage that has not been made  public and is known to them by virtue of their official position. These obligations do  not cease upon separation from service. Organizations must maintain guidelines for  the use and protection of confidential information, and it is equally necessary for  such guidelines to keep pace with developments in communications and other new  technology. It is understood that these provisions do not affect established practices  governing the exchange of information between the secretariats and member States,  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  46/48    which ensure the fullest participation of member States in the life and work of the  organizations.        Respect for different customs and culture    40. The world is home to a myriad of different peoples, languages, cultures,  customs and traditions. A genuine respect for them all is a fundamental requirement  for an international civil servant. Any behaviour that is not acceptable in a particular  cultural context must be avoided. However, if a tradition is directly contrary to any  human rights instrument adopted by the United Nations system, the international  civil servant must be guided by the latter. International civil servants should avoid  an ostentatious lifestyle and any display of an inflated sense of personal importance.        Security and safety    41. While an executive head assigns staff in accordance with the exigencies of the  service, it is the responsibility of organizations to ensure that the health, well-being,  security and lives of their staff, without any discrimination whatsoever, will not be  subject to undue risk. The organizations should take measures to protect the safety  of their staff and that of their family members. At the same time, it is incumbent on  international civil servants to comply with all instructions designed to protect their  safety.        Personal conduct    42. The private life of international civil servants is their own concern and  organizations should not intrude upon it. There can be situations, however, in which  the behaviour of an international civil servant may reflect on the organization.  International civil servants must therefore bear in mind that their conduct and  activities outside the workplace, even if unrelated to official duties, can compromise  the image and the interests of the organizations. This can also result from the  conduct of members of international civil servants' households and it is the  responsibility of international civil servants to make sure that their households are  fully aware of this.  43. The privileges and immunities that international civil servants enjoy are  conferred upon them solely in the interests of the organizations. They do not exempt  international civil servants from observing local laws, nor do they provide an excuse  for ignoring private legal or financial obligations. It should be remembered that only  the executive head is competent to waive the immunity accorded to international  civil servants or to determine its scope.  44. Violations of the law can range from serious criminal activities to trivial  offences, and organizations may be called upon to exercise judgment depending on  the nature and circumstances of individual cases. A conviction by a national court  will usually, although not always, be persuasive evidence of the act for which an  international civil servant was prosecuted; acts that are generally recognized as  offences by national criminal laws will normally also be considered violations of the  standards of conduct for the international civil service.         ST/SGB/2016/9        47/48  16-12690        Outside employment and activities    45. The primary obligation of international civil servants is to devote their  energies to the work of their organizations. Therefore, international civil servants  should not engage, without prior authorization, in any outside activity, whether  remunerated or not, that interferes with that obligation or is incompatible with their  status or conflicts with the interests of the organization. Any questions about this  should be referred to the executive head.  46. Subject to the above, outside activities may, of course, be beneficial both to  staff members and to their organizations. Organizations should allow, encourage and  facilitate the participation of international civil servants in professional activities  that foster contacts with private and public bodies and thus serve to maintain and  enhance their professional and technical competencies.  47. International civil servants on leave, whether with or without pay, should bear  in mind that they remain international civil servants in the employ of their  organization and remain subject to its rules. They may, therefore, accept  employment, paid or unpaid, during their leave only with proper authorization.  48. In view of the independence and impartiality that they must maintain,  international civil servants, while retaining the right to vote, should not participate  in political activities, such as standing for or holding local or national political  office. This does not, however, preclude participation in local community or civic  activities, provided that such participation is consistent with the oath of service in  the United Nations system. It is necessary for international civil servants to exercise  discretion in their support for a political party or campaign, and they should not  accept or solicit funds, write articles or make public speeches or statements to the  press. These cases require the exercise of judgment and, in case of doubt, should be  referred to the executive head.  49. The significance of membership in a political party varies from country to  country and it is difficult to formulate standards that will apply in all cases. In  general, international civil servants may be members of a political party, provided  its prevailing views and the obligations imposed on its members are consistent with  the oath of service in the United Nations system.        Gifts, honours and remuneration from outside sources    50. To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety,  international civil servants must not accept, without authorization from the  executive head, any honour, decoration, gift, remuneration, favour or economic  benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations;  it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and  other entities.  51. International civil servants should not accept supplementary payments or other  subsidies from a Government or any other source prior to, during or after their  assignment with an organization of the United Nations system if the payment is  related to that assignment. Balancing this requirement, it is understood that  Governments or other entities, recognizing that they are at variance with the spirit  of the Charter and the constitutions of the organizations of the United Nations  system, should not make or offer such payments.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  48/48        Conclusion    52. The attainment of the standards of conduct for the international civil service  requires the highest commitment of all parties. International civil servants must be  committed to the values, principles and standards set forth herein. They are  expected to uphold them in a positive and active manner. They should feel  responsible for contributing to the broad ideals to which they dedicated themselves  in joining the United Nations system. Organizations have the obligation to  implement these standards through their policy framework, including rules,  regulations and other administrative instruments. For their part, member States are  expected, through their allegiance to the Charter and other constituent instruments,  to preserve the independence and impartiality of the international civil service.  53. For these standards to be effectively applied, it is essential that they be widely  disseminated and that measures be taken and mechanisms put in place to ensure that  their scope and importance are understood throughout the international civil service,  the member States and the organizations of the United Nations system.  54. Respect for these standards assures that the international civil service will  continue to be an effective instrument in fulfilling its responsibilities and in meeting  the aspirations of the peoples of the world.    16-12690 (E)    290716  *1612690*    "
