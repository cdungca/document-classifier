Decides that accountability shall be defined as follows:      Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members  to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception.

Notes that the effective implementation of results-based management  requires the sustained and focused engagement by senior management, and in this  regard encourages the Secretary-General to assign the responsibility for the  successful implementation of results-based management methodology throughout  the Secretariat to a relevant member of his senior management team, and to  communicate this assigned responsibility to all stakeholders as a matter of priority;  A/RES/64/259  5    26.
