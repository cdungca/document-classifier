In the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"Investing in the United  Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide\" (A/60/846), it was recalled that the  General Assembly, in section I of its resolution 60/260, had requested proposals to  specifically define accountability as well as clear accountability mechanisms,  including to the Assembly, and to propose clear parameters for its application and  the instruments for its rigorous enforcement, without exception, at all levels. It was  also indicated that: (a) the Assembly had recently addressed the issue of  accountability in its resolution 60/254, in which it took note of the report of the  Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations  (A/60/312); and (b) accountability arrangements would be discussed further in  future reports, including those addressing human resources and the administration of  justice. It was further pointed out that the overall strategy of strengthening capacity  in the area of information and communication technology, exercising limited  discretion in budget implementation, enhancing financial management arrangements  and improving reporting mechanisms contributes to greater accountability through  improved transparency in management systems.   2.  Views have since been shared that it would be helpful if further attention were  paid at this time to accountability issues, including a definition of accountability, so  that related proposals regarding budget implementation, financial management and  reporting mechanisms might be considered against the background of accountability  concepts, frameworks and mechanisms. The present report has been prepared to  facilitate such consideration in connection with the above-mentioned report, and in  particular the addenda thereto (A/60/846/Add.1-4). It has been prepared in the full  knowledge that, while there exist a multitude of accountability mechanisms and  procedures, there is a widespread perception that those mechanisms and procedures  have been of limited effectiveness to date. They require systematic and equitable  enforcement if in future the accountability system is to become a useful driver of  programme efficiency. The impact of many of the recently instituted accountability  measures of 2005 and 2006 has yet to be felt, as such measures are implemented one  step at a time. Further steps are to follow upon the completion of ongoing studies of  governance and oversight, human resources and the administration of justice.        II. Definition      3.  The call for a definition of accountability follows the use of the term by the  General Assembly in several different ways, in a variety of contexts and under  various agenda items in recent years. While the most recent report submitted by the  Secretary-General on the subject (A/60/312) was issued under the agenda items on  financial reports and audited financial statements and reports of the Board of  Auditors, and review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations, some of the earlier discussions have also taken  place under the agenda items on human resources management and United Nations  reform: measures and proposals.  4.  These considerations of accountability date back more than 10 years and have  resulted in the issuance of a number of reports that have shown that the term  \"accountability\" has been applied to two distinct aspects of the same issue. It has  been applied, on the one hand, to the broad responsibility of the Secretary-General  A/60/846/Add.6      4  06-39477    to Member States for the use of resources and the delivery of programmes and  services (results) and, on the other hand, more narrowly, for the responsibility of  individual staff members to the Secretary-General for performance of duties and  ethical conduct. Any acceptable definition of the concept of accountability in the  United Nations context would, therefore, need to take into account both the  institutional and the personal aspects of accountability as currently understood in  the Organization.  5.  While the Assembly has requested a definition of accountability, it is  understood that the request is for a working definition that may be applied in the  context of arrangements existing under the United Nations Charter. Accordingly,  definitions available from academic or legal sources and textbooks would require  adaptation before they could be adopted for general use in the United Nations. In  fact, the best definition of institutional accountability in the United Nations will  reflect the concrete arrangements put in place, with the approval of Member States,  for a framework to specify how the Secretary-General is held responsible for the use  of resources and delivery of results. This is achieved by the operation of a set of  transparent mechanisms that define the chain of responsibility and authority  downward from the level of the Secretary-General to all individual staff members  and specify the related reporting mechanisms upward from the lowest level of staff  back to the Secretary-General and onward to the intergovernmental level (see  annex I).  6.  The definition of personal accountability will reflect the requirement for an  individual staff member to explain and justify to his or her superior the performance  of his or her defined duties and responsibilities and also to be answerable for his or  her conduct, whether good or bad.  7.  The General Assembly may therefore wish to consider adopting the following  accountability definitions:    (a)  Institutional accountability: the responsibility of the Secretary-General to  explain and justify to the General Assembly and other relevant intergovernmental  bodies, in a systematic framework and by an orderly process using transparent  mechanisms, the performance of the Organization in using resources to achieve  results mandated by the Member States in the Assembly and/or other  intergovernmental bodies established under the Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  Personal accountability: the duty of an individual staff member to  exercise defined responsibilities appropriately, with a clear understanding of the  consequences, and to explain and justify to the official who conferred the authority  the results achieved and the manner in which the authority has been exercised.        III. Chain of responsibility, authority and accountability      8.  As described in earlier reports on accountability, the chain of responsibility,  authority and accountability flows institutionally from the intergovernmental organs  to the Secretary-General and personally to managers and staff members. Under  Article 97 of the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization; the mandates promulgated by the principal organs are entrusted to  him for their implementation under Article 98. The Secretary-General is therefore  accountable to the Member States for the implementation of those mandates. The    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  5    Secretary-General's discretion as chief administrative officer is governed by Articles  100 and 101 of the Charter and by the staff, financial and programme planning  regulations adopted by the General Assembly. His managerial discretion is exercised  under the mandates given to him collectively by Member States and with the  resources they make available to carry out those mandates. The responsibilities of  Member States are also specified in many of those legislative mandates and, where  specialized intergovernmental bodies are concerned, in their terms of reference.  9.  A comprehensive system of accountability is based on the premises that  responsibility must be clearly defined, managers and staff must have the resources,  capacity and authority to carry out their respective responsibilities, and  accountability must be established at all levels through appropriate mechanisms.  Such an accountability system has existed within the Organization for many years  and has been described, updated and discussed in a number of reports of the  Secretary-General, the most recent being his report on measures to strengthen  accountability at the United Nations (A/60/312). As is the case with most systems  and the related measures and processes for implementation, full compliance and  effectiveness require awareness, understanding, knowledge and timely application.  An important element of the accountability system is the reporting requirement  whereby Member States are kept informed of the management of the Organization's  programmes and financial and human resources. Such transparent reporting allows  Member States to provide policy direction, to review the status and effectiveness of  implementation, to consider the continuing validity of mandates and to take  decisions on future action to be taken by both Member States and the Secretary- General.  10. Recent enhancements to the accountability system within the Secretariat  include, for example, the implementation of results-based management; the  establishment of the Management Performance Board in 2005, the Ethics Office in  2006 and the Oversight Committee in 2005; enhancement of the Performance  Appraisal System; protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct in 2006;  the expanded and strengthened financial disclosure requirements in 2006; improved  performance data; and expansion of training for all levels of staff. Beyond the  Secretariat, the General Assembly, pursuant to its resolution 60/1, decided to  establish the Independent Audit Advisory Committee to assist it in discharging its  oversight responsibilities and, in its resolution 60/248, requested terms of reference  and related resource requirements. This is a key strategic change which, once fully  implemented, will greatly improve the quality of auditing as a core component of  the Assembly's oversight of the Organization. Such measures and others already  described in previous reports are intended to ensure that the legislative mandates are  implemented in the most effective and efficient manner.   11. Elements of an effective accountability system, summarizing earlier reports  and hereby updated, include:     (a)  A clearly defined institutional/governance framework. Such a framework  includes the Charter; legislative mandates (emanating from principal and subsidiary  bodies); and staff, financial and programme planning regulations and rules, policies  and procedures. In this connection, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/1,  the question of governance and oversight is currently being addressed by an  independent external evaluation, which will include measures to further strengthen  the governance and oversight framework, particularly with regard to the operation  A/60/846/Add.6      6  06-39477    of results-based management and related programme monitoring and evaluation  activities; the results of the evaluation will be transmitted by the Secretary-General  to the General Assembly. Within the institutional/governance framework, the  Secretary-General is institutionally accountable to Member States; all other staff  members are personally accountable to the Secretary-General;    (b)  A clear definition of responsibility and authority and results to be  achieved. This includes a determination of which staff members are responsible for  what, what they are meant to do and achieve and within what regulations and rules;  and clear objectives, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement. In  this connection, some of the recent measures effected in 2005 and 2006 include the  following:     (i)  Establishment of executive decision-making committees (see annex II);    (ii) A mandatory induction framework for senior managers;     (iii) An improved senior management compact;     (iv) An enhanced Performance Appraisal System;     (v)  Ethics training;     (vi) Access to information concerning decisions of the Secretary-General in  disciplinary matters;    (c)  Adequate resources and tools to implement mandates. This element of  the accountability system requires payment by Member States of assessments on  time, in full and without conditions; effective management tools (plans, budgets,  monitoring and evaluation); and effective human resources management;    (d)  Effective monitoring and oversight of programme, budgetary and staff  performance. The effective measurement of programme delivery and achievement  of results requires:    (i)  Effective oversight mechanisms (Management Performance Board,  Oversight Committee,  Office of Internal Oversight Services, Board of  Auditors, Joint Inspection Unit);    (ii) Effective internal controls (control environment, risk assessment, control  activities, information, communication and monitoring);    (iii) Improvements in monitoring and self-evaluation, including updating and  upgrading monitoring and evaluation tools;    (iv) Enhanced  accounting  standards,  as  proposed  in  document  A/60/846/Add.3, through the adoption of the International Public Sector  Accounting Standards;    (v)  Enhanced Performance Appraisal System;    (vi) Ensuring ethical conduct, financial disclosure and whistle-blower  protection;    (e)  Effective follow-up and clear, meaningful consequences. This element  requires effective measures and sanctions for dealing with non-compliance and with  poor performance, underperformance and non-performance. In this connection, the    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  7    administration of justice Redesign Panel will be submitting its recommendations to  the General Assembly at the sixty-first session.  12. In implementing the accountability system, the Secretary-General expresses  his accountability to Member States in reports submitted to them, as representatives  of the principal organs of the United Nations or as representatives of the subsidiary  intergovernmental bodies. Member States in turn exercise their oversight  responsibility for programme performance and take decisions thereon. Programme  managers are personally accountable to the Secretary-General, who exercises his  responsibility for ensuring programme monitoring and improving staff performance.        IV. Accountability for results       13. The work of the Organization is conducted pursuant to legislative mandates  adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social  Council and their subsidiary bodies. For the regular budget, those legislative  mandates are translated into programmes and subprogrammes, which are formulated  in accordance with the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the  Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8). The strategic framework serves as the  basis for the formulation of the biennial programme budgets. The Secretary-General  monitors the delivery of outputs and the achievement of expected accomplishments.  The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning also provide that all  programmed activities shall be evaluated. With respect to peacekeeping operations,  the development, review, approval and administration of their budgets follow  similar results-based budgetary and implementation procedures.  14. The Secretary-General is thus institutionally accountable to Member States for  the proper management of the Organization and the implementation of its mandated  programmes and activities. The Secretary-General delegates authority to senior  officials who are, in turn, personally accountable to him. There are reporting  requirements throughout the cycle of planning, budgeting, implementation,  monitoring and evaluation of activities, and Member States have the opportunity to  hold the Secretary-General accountable for actions taken to implement legislative  mandates. Reporting requirements include status or progress reports on  implementation, programme and budget performance reports, specific reports  requested by intergovernmental bodies and evaluations of the work of the  Organization to determine relevance, efficiency and effectiveness. In this  connection, in addition to reporting requirements with respect to elements of the  programme planning cycle, the Management Performance Board and the Oversight  Committee, both of which were established in 2005, are expected to monitor the  manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been  delegated to them with respect to programme management, including financial and  human resources management, and to report thereon to the Secretary-General (see  annex III).  15. Member States exercise their oversight responsibility by holding the Secretary- General accountable for the achievement of measurable results. This in turn requires  a management culture that focuses on attaining clearly articulated objectives  through the achievement of results. Good performance indicators are essential for  measuring whether or not the expected results were achieved. These elements are  A/60/846/Add.6      8  06-39477    fundamental for results-based management, the full implementation of which will  represent a significant step towards reaching the goal of accountability.   16. The challenges facing the Organization with respect to the effective  management of programmes include the enhancement of results-based management,  the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation activities and the improvement of  internal controls. Training and certification of acquired skills and knowledge are key  to ensuring more effective implementation of programmes.  17. It is noted that the programme evaluation system is separate and distinct from  the personnel performance appraisal system. Since the programme evaluation  system is concerned with programme effectiveness and impact rather than the  performance of individual staff members, no information shall be transmitted  between the two systems (Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning,  rule 107.3 (c)). At the same time, the Management Performance Board, in addition  to assessing the functioning of individual departments and offices and the manner in  which they discharge their responsibilities, will be holding senior managers  accountable should problems arise.         V. Accountability for management of financial resources      18. As mentioned above, there is a system in place, including regulations and  rules, for the planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of the Organization's  programmes and activities. Once the budgets are approved by the General Assembly,  authorization to incur expenditures is issued under the authority of the Controller in  the form of allotment advices, including staffing table authorizations. Various  administrative instructions set out the procedures and norms governing the different  items of expenditure. Extrabudgetary resources are subject to the same financial  management systems as those provided under assessed budgets.   19. The Financial Rules establish a clear and hierarchical structure in the  delegation of authority. The Secretary-General delegates authority and responsibility  for the implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules to the Under- Secretary-General for Management, who in turn formally and publicly delegates this  authority to the Controller, except for the implementation of the Financial  Regulations pertaining to procurement and property management, which are  normally delegated to the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  The Controller and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services  delegate some carefully defined aspects of their authority to the executive officers  of departments and to heads of administration in offices away from Headquarters.  Delegation of authority is done on a personal basis and not by virtue of the office  held by the staff member. Financial or procurement authority can be further  delegated by the executive officers or heads of administration, but the Controller  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services remain ultimately  accountable for its use. Delegation of authority is always done in writing and signed  by those to whom the authority has been delegated. In this connection, it is  recognized explicitly in the Financial Rules that accountability does not abrogate the  responsibility of those delegating authority. Exercise of delegated authority requires  the competency, knowledge and skills to ensure full compliance with the  instruments for internal controls. In this connection, greater attention will need to be  given in future to the timely issuance of guidelines, mandatory training and    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  9    certification of acquired knowledge and skills in order to strengthen accountability  for financial management.  20. The internal financial control systems of the Organization are based on the  concept of checks and balances, fundamental to which is the segregation of duties,  so that transactions require approval and scrutiny by more than one individual. The  internal control system entails the designation of staff with certifying or approving  authority; other staff are responsible for signing cheques, operating bank accounts  and effecting payments. The financial and staff regulations and rules contain explicit  provisions to protect the Organization against any financial loss that might result  from a staff member's violation of such rules. Financial rule 101.2 reads:    All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who  contravenes  the  Financial  Regulations  and  Rules  or  corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions.   In this connection, an administrative instruction was issued (ST/AI/2004/3) for the  purpose of implementing the provisions of financial rule 101.2 and staff rules 112.3,  212.2 and 312.2, detailing the conditions under which staff members may be  required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial  loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of the staff member's gross  negligence or of his or her having violated any regulation, rule or administrative  instruction.   21. During any financial period the Secretary-General's accountability to Member  States for the management of financial resources is reflected in the ongoing reports  Member States receive on financial and budgetary issues, including reports on the  financial situation, financial statements, audits, resource requirements, budget  performance, statements of programme budget implications and other reports as  requested by Member States, to facilitate their decision-making on the utilization  and prudent stewardship of the funds of the Organization. Financial and programme  adjustments are reported to Member States for approval.   22. Member States, through examination by the Office of Internal Oversight  Services of compliance with policies, also hold the Secretary-General accountable  for the safeguarding of assets, the economical and efficient use of resources and the  effectiveness of programme performance. Similarly, Member States, through the  work of the United Nations Board of Auditors, hold the Secretary-General  accountable for the quality and accuracy of the accounts of the United Nations.        VI. Accountability for management of human resources      23. Under the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization (Article 97). He has the authority to appoint staff under regulations  established by the General Assembly (Article 101, para. 1). In the appointment of  staff and the determination of the conditions of service, the paramount consideration  is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity, with due regard paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a  geographical basis as possible (ibid., para. 3).  A/60/846/Add.6      10  06-39477    24. The authority to select staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is delegated  to heads of departments and offices, who are accountable to the Secretary-General  for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Under the staff selection  system, which applies to staff appointed under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, the  authority is exercised under the scrutiny of a central review body, which will ensure  that the process leading to the decision was properly followed.  25. The authority to administer staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is  delegated to senior officials who are personally accountable to the Secretary- General for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Those senior officials  may further delegate the exercise of elements of their own authority to other  officials, who will be answerable to them for the manner in which they performed  their functions.  26. Staff regulation 1.3 provides that staff members are accountable to the  Secretary-General for the proper discharge of their functions. Staff members are  required to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in  the discharge of their functions, and their performance is appraised periodically to  ensure that the required standards of performance are met.   27. Department heads submit to the Secretary-General a senior management  compact, which includes, in addition to programmatic and financial objectives,  specific human resources objectives and targets agreed upon by the department head  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management. The Office  of Human Resources Management is responsible for monitoring progress made  towards achievement of those objectives and targets. The Management Performance  Board is responsible for monitoring the manner in which senior managers exercise  all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their  performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans.  28. All other staff, up to and including those at the Assistant Secretary-General  level,1 are covered by the performance appraisal system (PAS). A key feature of  PAS is a clear definition at the beginning of the performance year by the staff  member and his or her supervisor of work objectives and associated performance  indicators. PAS has a midterm review and a year-end appraisal, at which point  performance is evaluated using the performance indicators defined at the beginning  of the year. Another key feature of PAS is that it assesses how staff demonstrate the  Organization's core values and competencies. All managers are evaluated against  the requisite managerial competencies.  29. Another important dimension of accountability is that all staff members,  regardless of level, are held to the basic obligations of proper conduct defined in  article 1 of the Staff Regulations and chapter 1 of the Staff Rules and are subject to  disciplinary measures when misconduct is established.   30. With respect to the accountability of the Secretary-General to Member States  for the management of human resources in the context of policies determined by the  General Assembly, reports on human resources management are submitted to the  Assembly on a regular basis for consideration, overall direction and decision- making. As requested by the Assembly in its resolution 60/260, further details on the  accountability mechanisms in respect of the Secretary-General's reform proposals  __________________    1  The governance and oversight evaluation is recommending that this be extended to the Under- Secretaries-General.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  11    relating to human resources management will be submitted to the Assembly at its  sixty-first session in the context of a detailed report to be provided in respect of the  human resources aspects of the report of the Secretary-General on investing in the  United Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide (A/60/692 and Corr.1).        VII. Accountability for management of procurement      31. The Secretary-General, in his report on procurement reform (A/60/846/Add.5),  has described concrete measures for implementing procurement reform focusing on  strengthening internal control measures, optimizing United Nations acquisition and  procurement management so as to reduce acquisition costs and strategic  management of United Nations procurement. These measures are aimed at  enhancing responsibility and accountability by promoting ethics and integrity in the  workplace (whistle-blower protection policy, training in ethics, Supplier Code of  Conduct, independent Bid Protest System), strengthening training programmes,  updating and/or modifying procurement processes (updated procurement manual,  improved terms and conditions for tenders, vendor roster, ex post facto cases) and  enhancing governance (risk management, contract compliance, oversight).  32. Delegation of authority, which does not abrogate the responsibility of the  official delegating the authority, for procurement activities needs to be closely  monitored. In this respect, authority is delegated formally to staff responsible for  procurement. The Secretariat will terminate such authority should serious flaws in  its exercise be discovered. At the same time, disciplinary measures are taken  wherever and whenever necessary based on established procedures currently in  place.  33. It should be noted that accountability for procurement activities does not rest  solely with procurement officers but also with requisitioners, who also need to be  fully trained and made aware of proper procurement practices. It is the  responsibility of requisitioners to have proper procurement plans so that actions for  the acquisition of goods and services can be taken on a timely basis and programme  results can be achieved in a cost-effective manner. The Secretariat has been  monitoring actions taken by requisitioners and continues to draw to their attention  instances where procurement procedures are not adhered to. For any serious breach  of conduct, disciplinary measures are taken, as appropriate.   34. The Secretariat continues to bring procurement staff at Headquarters and in the  field up to date on the concerns expressed by Members and by the auditors. In  addition to sharing knowledge and experience, there is a need to enhance training in  procurement-related activities throughout the Secretariat, which the Secretariat  plans to do. It is necessary to ensure that staff assigned to procurement activities  have the requisite knowledge and skills prior to assuming those responsibilities. In  this respect, the Secretariat ensures that new staff being recruited for procurement  functions have appropriate procurement experience and the necessary educational  background, preferably with certification in procurement. The Secretariat plans to  increase such procurement certification opportunities for current staff members as  well. Procurement staff assigned to field missions are technically cleared by the  Procurement Service prior to assignment.  35. One of the prerequisites for carrying out procurement activities in offices away  from Headquarters and in peacekeeping operations, outside the Procurement  A/60/846/Add.6      12  06-39477    Service, is the establishment of an adequate local capacity consisting of trained and  experienced officers. Once such capacity is fully established, procurement authority  may safely be delegated to offices and missions. Currently, the instrument of  delegation gives blanket authority to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,  which is then further delegated to individual procurement officers in the field. This  procedure is under review to determine whether a more focused arrangement would  be preferable in future to provide for sounder internal controls on procurement.        VIII. Conclusions and recommendations      36. Starting with the Charter, which sets out the purposes and principles of the  United Nations, there are many instruments that guide the work of the Organization- legislative mandates, regulations and rules, policies and procedures, administrative  issuances, guidelines, instructions, oversight and review bodies, and performance  standards. In addition, there are reporting requirements of Member States to address  issues related to the management of programmes, procurement and financial and  human resources. While such instruments provide legitimacy for the conduct of  business, they also impose limitations on the way the Secretariat performs its duties.  With the increase in field operations, as well as their complexity, there is an urgent  need to find better ways to balance the timely implementation of Security Council  and General Assembly mandates and the fulfilment of all procedural requirements.  It is important to have effective controls, and it is equally important to encourage  greater initiative and innovation in order to manage better and in a more timely  manner. An appropriate balance between the overall policy guidance from Member  States and the exercise of managerial discretion by the Secretary-General is  essential for meeting today's multifaceted and complex challenges in a timely and  effective manner.   37. The assumption of responsibility, and being held accountable for the  performance of functions and duties, require an awareness, understanding and  knowledge of the nature and scope of the regulatory framework. It is essential that  staff are well equipped to ensure compliance within that framework. To that end the  Secretariat will not only enhance, and enforce where applicable, training  programmes, but will also require in future certification of knowledge and skills  acquired for the performance of functions in the areas of finance, procurement and  human resources management.   38. Accountability should be viewed not only from the perspective of possible  malfeasance, but also from the perspective of competencies for programme  performance. Little attention has been given, within the Secretariat or by  intergovernmental bodies, to holding the Secretariat accountable for the  achievement of results. In reviewing programmes of work, the focus has been too  much on the pre-implementation stage and, unless there are glaring errors, fraud or  corruption, which inevitably draw attention, little time is given to determining  whether or not results were achieved and, if not, why not. Measures exist to deal  with inappropriate behaviour, negligence, and gross negligence, and they need little  enhancement. Measures to determine the adequacy of results achieved, the  soundness of management of results, financial and human resources, and  procurement and subsequent action to hold staff accountable are probably  insufficient, however.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  13    39. The General Assembly has repeatedly stressed the importance of strengthened  accountability and of ensuring greater accountability of the Secretary-General to  Member States for the efficient and effective implementation of legislative  mandates. Measures that have been put in place to ensure accountability for the  management of programmes and of financial and human resources have been  described in a number of reports over the past 10 years or so, the most recent being  the report of the Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the  United Nations (A/60/312). Follow-up action in implementing those measures has,  however, not been comprehensive. There is currently limited understanding of the  consequences of underperformance, poor performance, or non-performance. There  are currently no sanctions for the non-achievement of expected results. The  oversight of performance within the Secretariat rests on the shoulders of staff who  are appointed to sit on boards, panels and committees to undertake such reviews in  addition to their regular functions. It is not surprising that such oversight functions  are given lower priority when more urgent situations arise requiring immediate  attention.  40. A transparent and effective system of accountability and responsibility  demands more than setting out or revising procedures, regulations and rules. An  important element in the system is the continued promotion of a management  culture that encourages improved performance, higher levels of productivity and  better quality of work. Ethical behaviour and compliance with the standards of  conduct in the international civil service are required, as is an ongoing flow of  information within and among departments so that officials are fully aware, on a  continuing basis, of their respective responsibilities, particularly since coordination  and collaboration are essential for the implementation of many mandates.  41. As indicated above, details on accountability for human resources management  and in relation to results-based management will be addressed in the reports on  reform of human resources management and on governance and oversight  respectively, to be submitted to the General Assembly later this year.  42. The General Assembly may wish to:    (a)  Welcome the present report and endorse the definitions of  accountability provided in paragraph 7 above;    (b)  Note that a sound legal framework for accountability exists in the  United Nations, consisting of, inter alia:    (i)  The Charter;    (ii) The Financial Regulations and Rules;    (iii) The Staff Regulations and Rules;    (iv) The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and  the Methods of Evaluation;    (v)  The rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which specify the  duties of the Secretary-General and of the Secretariat;    (vi) Procedures set out in regulations and rules, as well as in a substantial  number of General Assembly resolutions, which govern reporting by the  Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the use of financial and  A/60/846/Add.6      14  06-39477    human resources and on results-based programme implementation,  including monitoring and evaluation;    (vii) Procedures governing the reporting to the General Assembly by  oversight bodies, including the Board of Auditors and the Office of  Internal Oversight Services;    (c)  Note that the accountability framework of the United Nations has  been strengthened in 2005 and 2006 through:    (i)  The establishment of the Ethics Office and the provision of  systematic mandatory ethics training for staff;    (ii) Protection against harassment and retaliation for reporting  misconduct;    (iii) Strengthened financial disclosure requirements;    (iv) The establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee;    (v)  The establishment of the Management Performance Board to hold  senior officials accountable for the conduct of their functions;    (vi) The establishment of the Oversight Committee to strengthen  compliance with approved audit and oversight recommendations;    (vii) The establishment of executive decision-making committees;    (d)  Note that further enhancements to the United Nations accountability  system may be anticipated in the light of recommendations expected from the  ongoing review of United Nations governance and oversight and of the internal  justice system;    (e)  Request the Secretary-General to continue strengthening the  effectiveness of the accountability system through:    (i)  Improvements in results-based budgeting and management;    (ii) Ensuring that sanctions in the accountability system are applied  through rigorous enforcement without exception at all levels;    (iii) Ensuring that adequate incentives are in place to reward good  performance.
